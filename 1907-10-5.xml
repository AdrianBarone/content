                    for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr. Najem Houry
                    proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent
                    Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to
                    Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
                    Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                    Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                    begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                    Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                    scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                    in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                <p> GERMANY AND PRUSSIA. Considerable interest has been aroused in Germany by an article, which has lately appeared in an important German magazine containing a criticism of the state of Germany with special reference to the predominance of Prussia, Germany has nothing to fear from internal dissensions. She is united and will remain united. But she has much to gain from the free discussion of her own affairs and conditions, and has suffered from the tendeney, which has long been marked, of ber writers and instructors to busy themselves and their readers rather with the affairs of other countries than with those of Germany. A sore point with some of the Germans is the preeminence or predominance of Prussia, says the "Morning Post" though it has arisen nator ally enough from the course of events by which Germany became united. Prossin is not and never was a nation; the name stands first for a province, then for a dynasty, and then for a State the creation of that dynasty. But it is the dynasty and the State that united Germany and has in that way won its place at her head. The Prussian tradition has stamped itself on German history. But this same tradition isin many respecta alien to Germany at large and by no means acceptable to the people of an or parts of the Empire. The Prossian state was mad by the House of Hohenzollern, who, starting as Margraves of Brandenburg, obtained a Pro sian province and spent the time between the Reformation and the Revolution in trying to raise their monarchy into a Great Power Frederic the Great found himself as a young man left as an absolute monarch with a welldrilled army, an obedient bureaucracy, aud his own ambition. He had a certain claim to the province of Silesis, at that time in Austrian possession, and he took his opportunity to invade and seize that province, which he was able to keep during the series of wars into which its occupation led him. He managed also to obtain a share of Poland, and bis successors of the revolutionary erafwere mainly preoccupied with the effort to obtain more territory-at one time in Poland, at another in Hanover-until in the struggle against Napoleon Prussis was crushed and reduced to a small ares between the Elbe and the Baltio. The Prussia of those days had prodaoed no great man except Frederio the Great, but as the rest of Germany was under French protection the patriots looked to Prussis whose Princes were very glad to enlist such talents as they could into their service. The Steins, Scharnhorsts and other great men who made the Prussia of 1818 were Germans but for the most part not Prussians. Even Moltke, though a German, was not a Prussian by birth. The country was despotically governed until 1848, when in the terror caused by the Revoluion. Hence. The Germans, therefore, have no neer! to go abroad, nor even outside of Prussia, for
                    model of the qualities that all the world loves
                    There is, however, something more than the distinction between Prussian hardness and South German softness at the bottom of the South German dissatisfaction, Germany fifty years ago was democratic in spirit. Prussia, except as regards a part of its urban population is dominated by the spirit of aristocracy or caste. The domestio strife of Germany will for a long time be between the tradition of the Prussian squires and that of the Radicals of the South-West. It is not a geographical conflict, but the types have local associations dating from the middle of the last century. The feeling is widespread that the Empire under Prossian guidance is imbued with more than a due share of the Prussian spirit, and that the Empire tends to develop more than it should along the old automatio lines and fails to assimilate what was best in the national democratic movement of sixty years ago. Perhaps both elements are needed for a full development of German national life.

                </head>
                <p>"A gentleman who holds an official position in Egypt" recently made the following state ment, says the "Daily Graphic": -
                    "The Egyptian soilis becoming impoverished. In olden days the land during high Nile received that deposit of mud which gave it a new lease of life rendering the application of of a fertiliser less necessary than at present. Systems of irrigation and damming are alter ing all this. Summer crops are grown. Acoordingly more is taken out of the land, wbile at the same time it receives less. Egypt has no natural manure to give to the land. What manure there is is used for fuel, for which purpose it is not only cheap, but its peculiarproperties make it very suitable. Tbere is, however, a substance which for ages has been used as a fertiliser. It is found in little heaps and hills and is the residue of the clay and straw composition which the Jews used in making bricks.
                    This substance, known as confri, is exceedingly rich in ammonia. In the past there seemed an almost unlimited supply of it, but it is clear now that it is becoming exhausted. The best hills are being used up, and the fellah has to go further afield for his supply. There is no hope, therefore, that confri will provide the fertiliser for which soon there will be a very great demand."

                </head>
                <p>A large area of land in Figypt, about midway between Assuan and Ecko, and consisting of some 12.000 acres i mider preparation for irrigation and in order to carry out the proat it has been necessary to construct a steel canal of nearly a mile in length. The east bank of the Nile at Kom Ombo is too low to allow of the land being irrigated at floodtide in the usual manner, and in vier to obtain an adequate supply it was necessary to put down sets of powerful and specially designed pumps. These pumps lift the water throngh suction mains 64 tt, in diameter, and discharge it into riveted steel rising mains of the same capacity, which in their turn deliver the water into a service reservoir. A large steel canal starts from this service reservoir, and delivers the water into distributing earth canals or culverts, from which it flows on to the land. The lift of the pumps is from 16 to 22 yards, and the top of the reservoir wall is 115 yards above sea level at Alexandria. The canal is composed of riveted steel, the plates being 1/4 in. thick. It is nearly semi-circular in form, 6 1/2 yards in diameter, with 20-in. straight sides; being. therefore, at the top, nearly 19ft. deep. It is subdivided into seventeen sections, averaging nearly 105 yard each. This was done in order to allow for expansion and contraction, the sections being connected by masonry basins and packed expansion joints. Timber cradles were placed about 30 ft. apart, to keep the bottom level, and props to prevent the sides from dropping out of shape. Great difficulty was experienced in preventing the sections from falling out of level, owing to the sand forming the foundations being blown from underneath by the wind and also much difficulty, due to the onequal expansion of the steel plates on the sunny side.

                </head>
                <p>LONDON, October 4. Ahmed Djelall Eddin Pasha, former oonfidant of the Sultan now in Cairo, in a letter to the Times" was the Porte that if the intolerable abuses under which Turks as well as Christians in Turkey are suffering are not remedied the Turks may have recourse to extreme violence
                    Ahmed Djelall Eddin declares that bitter experience shows that a second reign like the Sultan's is an impossibility in Turkey. He refers to the possibility of the proclamation of an Arab Empire in Mecor which wonld be supported by the whole of Islam. (Renster)
                </p>
                <p>
                    General Ahmed Djelalleddin Pasha, the brother-in-law of Prince Omar Pasha Toussoon and Prince Djemil Pasha Toussoun, has been a well-known figure in Cairo for the past few years. His wife died a few years ago and was buried in the Mosque of Nebi Daniel at Alex andris. Since her death her husband, who for more than ten years was the most powerful and honorable of the Sultan's advisers, has resided in Egypt and resisted all the blandishmerits of the Sublime Porte to induce him to go back to Stambonl.
                </p>
                <p>An Eaglishman, who knew the Pasha at Constantinople, thus describes him :.
                    Djellaleddin Pasha was for years foremost and prime favorite among all the Sultan's subjects, and fully deserved the trust reposed in him as an honorableand upright gentleman. His dow.all, therefore, camem a shock to all who knew him, the greater, perhaps for that the re port added that he bad been denounced by the Seerat Police of the Palace, a force which he himselt created and organised, and of which, among many offices, he was been the working chiet. A remarkable and singularly fascinating personality, Ahmed Pasha's most alient quality was ever an absolutely whole
                    hearted devotion to his master and wheu at last the eneinies who ever dog the footsteps of Royal favorites succeeded inalienating from him Abdul Hamid's confidence and affection, the cir cumstance was received as indicating a further sinister advance in the progress of that be setting "manie de la persécution" which has for years haunted the gloomy potentate of Yildiz During his long term of honored ser vice Ahmed Pasha enjoyed an absolutely unique position in the Yildiz set. Privileges have been his which no other Turkish funer tionary would have dared to solieit. Of late yerrs, for instance, social communion between

                <p>setting "manie de la persécution" which has for years haunted the gloomy potentate of Yildiz During his long term of honored ser vice Ahmed Pasha enjoyed an absolutely unique position in the Yildiz set. Privileges have been his which no other Turkish fune tionary would have dared to solicit. Of late years, for instance, social communion between Turks and Europeans in the capital has been tacitly, and in some cases openly, probibited. Yet Ahmed was a prominent member of the "English" elnb, and to which practically all the English colony belongs in common with the chief members of other Eeropean com monities. Almost every day, indeed, Fridays excepted, during the many years I knew him, Ahmed Pasha took his place at the Bridge table--for Bridge was popular in Constantinople long before it was heard of in Europe, and it may be said that he is both a fine player and a good loser. It has often been suggested that this licensed association with Europeana was not wholly foreign to his functions as chiet of the Secret Police. As to this, how ever, it may be said that all who have known the Pasha were penetrated with the sense of his complete honorability. In proof of this is the fact that when Abdnl Hamid sought to end his differences with the chiefs in Paris of the "Young Turkey" party he employed in vain one intermediary after another until it was intimated to bim that the ses vices of Ahmed Djellaleddin as envity would procure the desired result. The Pasha, there. fore, was sent to Paris and on his representa tions the "Young Turkey" leaders complied
                </p>
                <p>It is noteworthy in this cunnection that Ahmed's influence with his master has sofficed to assure to them the immunity that he promised. It is within my knowledge that on several nocasions he has been urged to diverge from this line of conduct, and that at the risk of that loss of favor which has now overtaken him be invariably refused to put bis hand to any unworthy action. Oddly enough, until now this inflexibility has served rather than injured him in his master's eyes : for the Sultan, though reely using spies and traitors, has a wholesome contempt for such gentry. Covered with honors, only before his fall from favor recentiy, indeed, the Sultan bestowed on him the last and highest decoration in his gift.

                <p>A correspondent writes T50 very recently the French Governments action in Morocco AS the object of the severest criticism in the Nationalist Press, and more especially in the organ of the self-styled obief of the Nationalist movement which made a point of exaggerating the damage done by the bombardment of Casablanes, of criticising the attitude of the French Government during the Algeciras conferer.ce and its Moroccan policy during the last twelve month, and of quoting from every toreign journal which had shown any hostility to France, stories which, as a correspondent of a London paper recently remarked, were calculated to spread the belief that the violation of women, the massacre of unoffending Jews and Moslems and the pillage of the town were the work not of the tribes but of General Drude's soldiers. Despite this hostility the French Press continued to publish the effusions of the angrateful Kamel and certain Parisian organs, while anxiously protesting that France had no intention of committing any action that might be constructed by England as a breach of the Anglo Prench Agreement of 1904, suggested that British statesmen might listen to the pleadings of the "sportsman" of the Egyptian patriots. Now a rumour is going round the Cairo cafés to the effect that the "Sllustrious Karamel" of M. G. Vayssié, or the "sincere patriot" of Mme. Juliette Adam has obtained financial support, not of course from the French Government, but from individuals in France who conceive that their interests will thus be furthered, though we fail to see how) by aiding the Pasha's journalistie ventures. This assistance is said to have been given on the condition that the Mustaphist organs should abandon their pro Moroccan Campaign. Such is the story which in my opinion must be swallowed with more than one grain of salt. But whatever the canse it is certainly A ouridus fact that the extreme nationalists should have abandoned their co-religionists for whom they were prepared to sbed their ink in torrents, without any explanation, and that the French Press shonld at the same time unite in giving sneh an excel lent advertisement to their leader.

                <p>The late F. Du Pre Thornton's Elementary Arabic: a Grammar,' based upon Wright's well-known grammar, and published in 1905, was so well received by students that he at once set to work upon an Elementary Arabic First Reading Book, and 30 nearly completed it before his death that its editor, Mr. R A. Nicholson, had little more to do than to complete the glossary and revise the proofs. It is now issued by the Cambridge University Press, printed for the most part from Lane's Arabic type, which has the merits of cleatness and compactness; and the little book appears to us well adapted to its purpose. It is largely 8 reprint of Wright's 'Arabie Reading Book,' wbich has long been out of print ; but Wright's text has been amended, partly by his own corrections and partly by the critical revision of Prof. de Goeje and the present editor. Some of the selections offer difficulties which seem rather baffling to beginners, but there are not many which cannot be overcome by the use of the careful glossary, which is a model of what A glossary should be complete, coneixe, and accurate. The extracts from the Koran are perbaps over short, and we should have liked to see some of the early impassioned Mekks Surahs included, but the elaborate 'Gramma matical Analysis' occupying 77 pages, of the whole of the Koran extracts is an admirable feature, with its full parsing and explanations and its precise references to the Grammar.' The Preface repeats some useful advice to students previously given in the "Grammar, but we cannot refrain from expressing our satisfaction that Mr. Thornton did not extend bis activities to å treatise on Boglish. The following is hardly a model of lucid style : "During one among many instructive con versations, he told me in 1880 tbat Hebraists who had incurred the like entanglement, invariably tried to set themselves free on hearing the korin recited by Moslems (Mahometans); and through learning to do likewise endeavour, more wily than in any other way, to prono once distinctly and well the difficult consonants of Hebrew at well as of Arabio."

            <div type="item">
                <p>"La Revue des Deux Monde" says of the Egyptian financial trouble that it is due largely to the speculative uses to which the money (too easily lent by the banks) was put. At the beginning of this year (1907) any reflecting mind could picture the approacning tempest. From January to June forty-four now oompanies-nearly all English were fosted for working in Egypt. The total most being subscribed in Egypt itself--of the capital was £9,250,000, not to speak or the increases of some of the already existing companies during
                    the nume six months. The writer, however, does mot anticipate that the depreciation in values
                    will extend to wrhen lands throughout the country. But he dreads the possible effect on the price of cotton, which material make up 85 per cent of the exports and pags for the imports. Cotton governed the situation, and the spinners inay see in the prem ituation a chance to buy cheap. The prospects, both immediate and later of this commodity the nothing less than brilliant, as far as produetion goes. The moral is that Egypt must, like other countries have ita crises bet that its economie situation is based on cotton,
                    the present situation of which is excellent and the future secures to production. An other view is that given by the "Semaphore" of Marseilles, which foresees only prosperity for Bgypt, dne principally to her power to buy becanse of her cotton crops. England takes balf of her cotton and France takes thirty-six million francs' worth out of the total of 411 millions, vaule of product. Germany share is thirty five millions, and so on; and what has largely contributed to further develop Egypt's production has been the marked disposition shown by the United States to mone poliseootton and manipulate the markets. The other Agrionitoral producte of Bgypt include the g ame which is becoming important Land improved t he Custos tarifs have been reduced some area free, such as coal, minerals, wood and it beeld hardly be mid that of the about 95 per cent is from England Th article is an argument in favour of schoorrale tions between Egypt And the south of Prince, and in a compliment paid to English adminis tration, which has prepared a market so worthy of other manufacturing countries attention.

                    <p>The popularity of King Elward VII. has brought about this miracle, that it has rallied all the English without exception round the throne, and has led Dernocrats, and Revolutionists to abandon the fetichism of the Re publican doctrine and of manhood suffrage. Seeing that monarchical Government prodaved good results, they have not dreamt of offering it systematic opposition on account of its here. ditary origin; on the contrary, the most advanced among them proclaim that King Ed ward VII. is the best of presidents, and his monsrohy the best of Republics.

                    <head>THE CAIRO SOCIETY POR THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN.
                    </head>
                    <p>We extract the following from the latest edition of "Orient and Occident"
                    </p>
                    <p>Our readers will remember that in a previol number we published an article under the bead of Healthy Homes." It was one of the last articles which came from the pen of our be loved departed friend, Mr. Thornton, who was greatly interested in the subject, and very much had at heart the question of the housing shd tursing of children and infants. We now Test that Dr. Abdul-Azit-Nazmi physician to the Public Wakfs, has planned the formation of a society whose aim is the protection of children from all the dangers which beset them physeally and morally. The whole plan is explained in a booklet which Dr Nazmi has recently pubHshed, and we hope that the pro ject will be greatly appreciated by parents. The proportion of careless or ignorant inothers is so high that, under the roof of thousands of houses, little infants are to be seen neglected by their ignorant mothers and left to the tender mereies of chance and environment Below is a precis of the plan and ideals of the society
                    </p>
                    <p>Article (1). The Cairo Society for the Protection of Children aims at the following por poses :
                    </p>
                    <p>(2) To protect infants from all the dangers that menace their health, education, and future
                    </p>
                    <p>(3) To advertise the hygienic law. by which the health of infants may be protected and their mortality diminished and to acquaint parents with the best means which would help them in bringing up their infants and giving them a good moral and social training;
                    </p>
                    <p>(4) To institute special cbaritable Homes for the poor children and to provide for special schools for those of them who may be blind, deaf, dumb, or sick, under the inspection of specialists and trustworthy persons of wide knowledge and capacity;
                    </p>
                    <p>(5) To defend infants in general against the neg act of their parents or guardians, and the ill-treatment of all
                    </p>
                    <p>(6) To institute societies, schools, and proper work shops for children exposed to moral cor ruption, and to endeavour to ameliorate their characters after leaving the Reformatory, by teaching them an honourable draft which would help them to obtain an honest livelihood
                    </p>
                    <p>(7) To protect orphan children, and those as good as orphaned, riz., those whose parents may be in prison, exile, etc;
                    </p>
                    <p>(8) To protect little girls from the ricious men and women who trade with women's honour and chastity.
                    </p>
                    <p>Such is the outline of the aim of tlus society; and the means it desires to adopt for the effecting of its purposes are
                    </p>
                    <p>(1) By inquiring into the causes of intant diseases and mortality, and nopting effective measures to abolish it:</p>
                    <p>(2) By endeavouring to instruct mothers in the principles of hygiene which must be obsery ed in the nursing of their infants, and that by publishing special books, pamphlets, articles, etc., and distributing them to the public, free, or at a trifling price;
                    </p>
                    <p>(3) By aiding poor mothers who are their own babies and have more than two children,
                    </p>
                    <p>(4) By granting material or moral subven tions to those who act according to the principles of the society in bringing up their children and to those who aid it in advertise ing its aims, whether by writing books ard articles or by institutions, schools and societies for the same purpose
                    </p>
                    <p>(5) By aiding all such schools, institutions, or asylums in Egypt, whose purpose is to protect little children and teach mothers their duties towards their infants
                    </p>
                    <p>(6 and 7) By forming special committees for the inspection of children who are exposed to sanitary, moral, or social dangers, especially those in factories and work-shops.</p>
                    <p>We heartily hope that the project of Dr: Nazmi will be realized. The subject is an im portant one, for the girls of the present are the mothers of the future, and the boys of the day are the men of the morrow; and we must bring them up after the principle of a sound mind in a sound body
                    </p>
                    <p>It has been remarked by an English writer that the object of wars in general is to estab lish permanent pence. The war which must to day be wage must be directed against those mothers who leave their children to the mercy of circumstances. The war must go on unt permanent peace is guaranteed. The pillars of our future civilization are our little children, and in so far as we strengthen these pillars, in that measure will civilization progress and increase in stability. When we consider that the tide of babies, 80 to speak, is ever flowing, when we see the distressing con dition of the infant death rate in this country when we know that during the very moments of writing these lines scores of new babies are entering the world to wage an enequal, horrible battle with disease and death, to which many of them will miserably succumb: when all this is clear, what proof do we need to convince ourselves of the importance of this on use, and the critical position in which we stand to-day!
                    </p>
                    <p>The baby thrives in proportion as we look after it, and according to the latent power of He with which it is endued. It is of the ut most importance, therefore, that we should look after its food, clothes, and its environment from the moment when it begins to live. Let is not deceive ourselves by saying that the mother is the best judge of how her baby is to be brought up. The great proportion of mothers totally ignore the matter, and scarcely have an idea of the hygienic principles to which they must conform in bringing up their children,
                    </p>
                    <cb></cb>
                    <p>What better prof dors ed than the high rate of infant mortality to day !
                    </p>
                    <p>The subject is by no means an exhaustible one; it needs deep study and delicate investigation, and Rep is in great needs of institutions on which the future of its sons depende But it is to those of our Readers who are parents that we address these few lines, for they are the best intermediaires between us and the mothers of Egypt. May God hasten the day when every woman shall be her own educator, and every mother shall be able to be ber own doctor and counsellor.
                    </p>
                    <p>We hope to return to this subject another

              <head>THE PRESERVATION OF CHILD LIFE
              </head>
              <p>Where the tuml.food for the babe is not available, as is often the she, it is a matter of vital importance that thoroughly effect ive subotitaste be given. The want of this, ad the improper feeding that nevelte as a come
                  on is the one of the mods of deathe amongst children that should have been avoid ed. Statistiga that have recently been pablished show that in England and Wales alone over 120,000 cbilden die erety year onder twelve months of age. This is deplorable fact, and the public attention that has been directed to jt should have some pretioal ontoome. This mortality is largely due to improper foeding. It is not always possible to find a sapply of pure will, and the method of feeling is often accompanied with a want of one that tells im mediately on the delieste digestive organs of the infant. A pare milk food that is nemily digested As maternal milk, and eo modified as to contain the constituents in equal proportions, is provided by the "Allenbarys" Foodia. By their time vigorous growth and health are promoted mod ne dignative troubles need be fool. The Milk Poods are made from fresh, full cream milk, and Are a modified to remove the difference between cow's milk and Woman milk, whilst the wethod of manafastare in Macho shaolately precludes all impurity. A perfectly pure produnt is thus obtained which is both parked into tins and hermetically sealed by machinery. If the "Allenberys" Milk Poods were ved in very me where maternal milk is not obtain ble, the mortality amongst infants world be rently lewened, and much of the waste of ife that now takes place annually could be voided.
