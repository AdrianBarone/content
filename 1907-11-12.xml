                    <head>AMERIOA'S INCREASING TMPO RTS.</head>
                    <p>The following criticism in “Daons’ Jnterna- tional Review” for October fully
                        accounts for the financial hurricane which has passed over the United States
                        ; it reveals a veritable Rake’s. Progress, “but the actual condition was not
                        fully guaged when the. article was written. </p>
                    <p>Imports of merchandise continue to provide the striking features of the
                        foreign commerce if the United States, increasing so rapidly that the total
                        for eight months of the calendar year 1907 exceeds a billion dollars in
                        value, whereas it wax but a few years ago that the total for twelve months
                        attained that figure. While the increase in imports bas been most striking
                        in the latest comparison, it is found that expansion has been eteady for
                        many years. Thus, the total for August, 1907, was $125,792,156, or over
                        $20,000,000 more than in the same month last year, while that ex- ceeded
                        August, 1905, by $10,000,000, and the gains for the three precedipg years
                        averaged sbout $5,000,000. For five years the value of merchandise imported
                        into the United States in. the month of Angust has risen trom 378,923,281 to
                        the phenomenal total mention- “above, or about 60 per cent. The mid- summer
                        months are not normally months of maximem foreign commerce by any means, and
                        it is found that fiveofthe preceding eight months reported a slightly
                        heavier total of imports, but no month prior to December, 1906, even
                        appioximated the aggregate for last month.</p>
                    <p>The movement of exports has shown no such tendency to expand, but, on the
                        contrary, the total of $127,625,508 in August, 1907, was about $2,000,0C0
                        less than in the same month last year, and is swaller than any of the
                        intervening mOnths. In the méantime this country is falling behind as to its
                        international trade balance, the decline im exports and marvelous expansion
                        in imports bringing the movement +t merchandise so near an equili- briuim
                        that practically nothing is left to settle the many intangible balances. In
                        August exports exceeded imports only $1,833,852, to which may be added a net
                        ontgo of gold aud silver amounting to $3,470,307, or a total on all aconunts
                        of scarcely more than $5,000,000. This, obviously, will not begin to pay for
                        lreight and insurance alone ; to say nothing of the money sent home by
                        immigrants, expended by American tourists, required to pay dividends on
                        American securities beld abroa/, and all the minor items which are
                        invariably against the United States. There is one distinetly favorable fact
                        that may be mentioned in this coumection, namely, that the New York market
                        is Hot indebted to London and continental banke tor large advances through
                        sales of bills in the foreign exchange market, as was the case a year ago.
                        This is not due, by any means, to any indisposition on the part of America
                        to borrow the money, but foreign capitalists have needed funds at home, and
                        also felt some relactance about advance to this country, partly in view of
                        the crop wneertainty which did not promise to provide the customary supply
                        of commercial bills for settlement, and also to some extent on account of
                        unsettled confidence by the ex- tensive decline that occurred in American
                        securities. In this respect the situation has began to show distinct signs
                        df improvement, and with the growth of. confidence there will probably be a
                        tendency to inéfeasé loans of this nature. But itis fortunate at the present
                        time when the merchandise balance is no help in making settlements, that
                        these temporary loans have been transferred to banks in the United States,
                        as is shown by the last statement of the Jontroller of the Corrency in which
                        the na- tional banks alone increased loans and dis counts during the pxst
                        year by $379,600,000 in the face of liyuidation in Wall Street and some
                        contraction in other domestic depart- ments.</p>

                    <head>THE CASSA DI SCONTO.</head>

                    <p>The liquidation of the Cassa di Sconto of Alexandria which Suspended in June
                        is re- ported to be making tavourable progress. About 40% ot the sssets have
                        so far been already realised, and after the completion of the har- vest
                        further sums will come in. It seems certain that the creditors will be paid
                        in full, and that the shareholders will save a considerable part of their
                        capital. The shares which had fallen to Fr. 19 have therefore secovered to
                        Fr. 67. It is, indeed, expected to see them return to par. Plans are being
                        prepared to form a new bank to take over all assets.</p>

                        Consul General for the post- ponement of theappiication for the appointment
                        of an Offcial Liquidator of the Company. An adjournment was granted for the

                    <p>GREEK CURRANT MONOPOLY.</p>
                    <p>The report of the Société Privilégiée pour Favoriser la Production et le
                        Commerce du Raisin de Corinthe to hand is a satisfactory one The net profits
                        for the year are 1,426,000 drachmai, of which sum the Directors propose to
                        distribute a 6 per cent dividend of 15 frances per share, which will absorb
                        1,308,000 drachmai, the balance falling to the State, partly by tax and
                        stamp duty and partly in virtue of Article 9 of the Company's charter. As
                        this is only the second year of the monopoly, and as the great difficulty
                        encountered im the opposition of the Eglish grocers owing to the en price Ot

                    <p>HUNTERS.</p>
                    <p>Turkey's impecuniosity is, writes Reuter’s Constantinople correspondent, the
                        concession bunter’s opportunity ; the greater the financial embarassments of
                        the Government, the more soft and yielding jig. naturally becomes. Not for a
                        long’ time has the Treasury heen in such sore straits as is at present the
                        case. Not only are its needs and liabilities greater than usual, but its
                        prospects of revenue are very much worse, owing to the unfortunate economic
                        con- ditions prevailing, Furthermore, practically all available sources of
                        extraordinary relief are already mortgaged.</p>
                    <p>At such moments, everybody who is hunting for concessions or orders comes
                        forward with his schemes and tries to dazzle the Govern- ment with growing
                        offers which, it is claimed, would bring relief and plenty Ao the depleted
                        Treasury Most ofthese projects are too fun- tastic to deserve serious
                        considerations ; others, sound in themselves, have not proper backing;
                        finally, a few are business-like proposals, well supported, The Government
                        is inclined to lend a sympathetic ear to any offer which seems to have money
                        behind it, and, unfortnnately; be- lieves in the practicability of many
                        schemes which are quite unsound and unrealigable it consequently vews its
                        embarrassments with optimism, as it believes that it can always find reliet
                        in these expedieuts. This thought is in some measure resporsible for the
                        Porte’s dis- inclination to make a serious effort to disen- gage itself from
                        the: hopeless muddle in which its fiuances are involved.</p>

                    <p>AN EXCITING VOYAGE,</p>
                    <p>SALVAGE UNDER DIFFICULT</p>
                    <p>CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>
                    <p>The British SS. “Rowa,” Captain T: B. Jones, arrived yesterday afternoon from
                        Sweden with a cargo of timber consigtied to Mex«rs. Karam. During the voyage
                        a large quantity of timber was washed overboard. Exciting incidents occurred
                        during theattempts made by the crew of the “Rowa” to salvage the Danish
                        steamer “Ulfsborg,” which she picked up 100 miles from Tyne on the 19th
                        Ogtober, the “Ulfsborg” baving lost ber propeller. Experienc- ing the full
                        force of a hurricane the “Ulfsborg” was rolling fearfully, haying no cargo
                        on board. It was found impossible to launch a boat for the purpose of
                        trensferring a hawser @» the sea was running too high Life buoys were
                        floated from the “Rowa” with lines attached. and these were hauled on board
                        the “Ulfsborg” and by this mean's the tow ropes were fixed. The salvage work
                        was carried out under very ditficult circumstances indeed, owing to the
                        rescuing vessel having a heavy list to port. The Davish steamer was
                        successtuly brought into Tyne and handed over to a tug.</p>

                        opportunity of exhibiting their own produce and seeing that of others from
                        distant parts of the Island.</p>
                    <p>‘There were 1,141 entries for competition, which with 86 not for competitien
                        made gp 4 total of 1,177, as compared with, we anderstand, under 200 last

                        in the Island was represented. The Famagusta district, in spite of her
                        railway facilities, sent but very little. Larnaca, however, contributed some
                        very choice specimens of corn, frait and vegetables, carefully packed in

                        very rightly accompanied the Larnaca co signment, as it is largely due to

                        ment in grading and packing, which has taken place at that port, is due.</p>

                        made for the use of a more extensive ground next year. Again, the Committee
