                <p>TOMBORA AT KHARTOUM</p>
                <p>The Sultan Tombora, of the Bahr el-Ghazal, who is on a visit to Khartoum was
                    received by the Govenor-General on Friday week. He expressed his gratitude, for
                    the kind treatment with which he has been treated, and for the numerous presents
                    which have been bestowed upon him and his followers. He gave assurance of his
                    loyalty to the Government and his readiness to comply with its instructions, and
                    to rule his people in accordance with its regulations.</p>
                <p>On Saturday week a dinner was given at the Omdurman Zabtieh in honour of Sultan
                    Tombora and the other Sultans visiting Omdurman. Tombora was much pleased with
                    the phonograph which supplied the music for the occasion</p>
                <p>Sultan Tombora and his retinue, consisting of his son, his brother, his wives and
                    about a dozen servants left Omdurman yesterday week returning to his country. He
                    goes back carrying with him pleasant recollections of his short visit to these
                    parts. He has evidently been very favourably impressed with what he witnessed
                    here, and has expressed his desire to send four of his sons to Khartoam to be
                    educated at Gordon College.</p>
                <p>The “Sudan Times” says —</p>
                <p> The Sultan's a very genial person. He speaks Arabic fairly well. Asked about his
                    age he was not able to give a reply ; the Niams Niams</p>
                <p>do not seem to have a regular way of measuring time. But by bis looks one can
                    judge that he is between fifty and sixty years old He states that when Zabeir
                    Pasha was a young boy, and has no clear recollection of him. </p>
                <p> Tombora has a large number of wives, exact number of whom he does not know ; nor
                    does he seem to know the exact number of his children. But they are not less
                    than fifty, a number of whom are already established as sheiths of different
                    districts within his dominions. His successors as Sulton, will not be his oldest
                    son, but one of his younger children whom he has designated an account of being
                    more intelligent than the others, and hence more promising.</p>
                <p>He says that the Niam Niams are no longer cannibals. Cannibalism was practiced by
                    them in the past but on very rare ocassions. The people of a tribe never at the
                    flesh of their own tribesmen. But when a man got old or helplessly sick, he was
                    made a present of to another tribe which would feed upon his flesh, returning
                    the favour to the former tribe when they had a similar opportunity.</p>

                    <p>The Native Criminal Court presented an unusually animated appearance this
                        morning, when Judge Mohamed Bey Said took his seat on the bench to preside
                        at the trial of the officials of the Ports and Lights Administration accused
                        of bribery and corruption. The name of the late Secretary General of the
                        Administration, Socrates Spiro Bey, was called out in Court, but this
                        person, who is one of the accused, failed to put in an appearance,
                        preferring to remain in Europe. The next ex-official of the Administration
                        called was Attiah Effendi George, who is accused, together with Spiro Bey,
                        of having received a bribe of £54 from Hafez Gobran in order to promote him
                        to the post of chief storekeeper in the Administration. Attiah Effendi
                        George was present. The first witness calledbnwas Hafez Gobran, who stated
                        that he.did not wish to be appointed a clerk as Spiro and George suggested
                        he should be. He asked to be promoted to chief storekeeper, so the two
                        officials asked him for £100 to carry it through Finally he offered to pay
                        £6". He paid first £20 to George and agreed to’pay the balance afterwards.

                <head>CAIRO OPERA SEASON</head>
                <p>HERODIADE</p>
                <p>It is certainly a comfort after the ungainly fiasooes of last year to hear an
                    opera decently performed, without obvious failures in orchestra, chorus and
                    soloists. M. Poncet has evidently, though it is early in the season to judge,
                    made a far more careful and judicious selection. As to the opera itself,
                    Herodiade is hardly a piece for any but the baritones: the others have their
                    chance, but it ts hardly a “obeval de bataille” for them. Perhaps the reason
                    lies in the music. One cannot help feeling that Massenet was not in his element
                    ; he was hungering, perhaps unconsciously after the light timeful satirical
                    ‘genre,’ so apparent in his “Gongleur™ or “Cendrillon,” oppressed, it may be by
                    the solemnity and even andacity of his subject. For a moment he rises to it, in
                    the enrty of the priests, but then again the voluptuous, unsatisfied theme
                    intrudes. As to the performance, the chorus were sound all through, as was the
                    orchestra, though a trifle bald in parts. The prophet’s entry was marred by
                    overmuch noise in the wind instruments, and now and again in the chorus the
                    altos tended to overshadow the sopranos, and produce a slightly crude effect. M.
                    Soubeyran had as suggested, hardly that chance which should enable him to show
                    the best of his voice, but in the dungeon scene (or it should be grotto) he rose
                    to distinct excellence. His artticulation is notably good and clear, but
                    occasionally his attack seems to hesitate. Mile Magne as Salome was admirable
                    for technique, but also rather colourless : her voice sounded constrained at
                    moments. Mr. Vallette as Herod rose to the part ; his fine resonant voice suited
                    the part and the sentiment of the mosic, and he introduced shades and tones of
                    passion and longing with real effect ; whether he will do as well in other parts
                    remains to be seen. Mr. Loiglio was distinctly good as Phannel; he also has as
                    fine voice, full, deep, and true. On the whole it was a very even, creditable
                    performance, without any of the glaring massacres of downright bad singing that
                    spoilt last years opera. The rest of the repertoire which is varied and
                    interesting will doubtless show what the company can or cannot do. We may at
                    least hope that it will be a distinct improvement.</p>

                        reoranization of cadre.</p>
                    <p>1.—The credit of L.E. 72,000 inscribed on the budget of 1907 for the
                        reorganisation of the cadre is divided among the State Adninistrations to

                        staff.</p>
                    <p>2.—The classes of the administrative cadre are fixed as follows :</p>
                    <p>4th class from L.E. 5 to 8</p>

                        drawn from the credit L.E. 72,000 each administration should first proceed
                        to the claasification of its employees in the new cadre, the pay remaining
                        over after this classification will serve the chief distribution for a
                        better distribution of employments among the various classes of the cadre,
                        according to the needs of service, in such manner as to increase the
                        employments of the superior classes and to accord promotion on to the
                        deserving employees. </p>
                    <p>4.—As regards the technical staff the chiefs of the Department will prepare
                        the cadre which they judge best adapted to this staff within the limits of

                    correspondents, but we wish, in a spirit of fait play to all, to permit---within

                <p>COMPANIES IN EGYPT</p>
                <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                <p>Sir,—“Lex” has none too soon sounded the note of alarm as regards the
                    anamalousposition of English companies in Egypr having alien boards It behoves,
                    therefore, the shareholders in soi-disant English companies to be "up and
                    doing." So far as we know, and English court has no power that the Mixed
                    Tribanals have any such jurisdiction over the members of the board of an English
                    company are free from any criminal responsibility. It is a notorious that, as a
                    consequence of tis situation, many of these alien direrctors are simply the
                    "dummies" of an individual or of a company having an axe to grind. Let me
                    illustrate my meaning : According to English law, no director of a company can
                    be directly or indirectly interested, pecuniarily or other wise, in any
                    transaction supported by him as a member of the board. But, if he be an alien,
                    he can, with inpunity, vote for the employment of the company's capital or
                    reserves in the carrying out of schemes devised primarily for the profit of the
                    wire-pullers whose interests he represents. Might I suggest that some clearer
                    definition is necessary of the word "proprietor" in connection with the
                    qualification shares of a director. The evident legal meaning of the word is
                    that a director should have a real bona-fide interest in the company whose
                    interests he controls. Is this always so, in fact</p>
                <p>Yours truly,</p>
                <p>VIGILANT</p>
                <p>Alexandria, 7th December.</p>
