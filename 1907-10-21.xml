                            may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300
                            and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the Venetian
                            fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the

                    <p> Years of Awful Agony</p>
                    <p> Cured by Doan's Backache Kidney Pills</p>
                    <p>When interviewed - 18 months after her cure - by one of our representatives,
                        Mrs. M. Hughes, 70, Latimer Street, Liverpool, England, said: - "I am most
                        pleased to endorsed my previous statement"</p>
                    <p>The following is the story of Mrs. Hughes' illness, in her own words: "I
                        first had medical treatment nine years ago, and the doctor tole me that my
                        trouble arose from the kidneys and that it would be necessary to draw the
                        water from my body with an instrument; my back was frightful. For nearly
                        three years before I called in the doctor I had been suffering from stabbing
                        pains that used to strike right across the small of me back, At times I
                        would have to stand to gte my breath until the pain eased - it was like a
                        knife being driven into my back. When at last I saw the doctor the pains
                        were so bad and I was in such a serious state that I had taken to my bed. I
                        also suffered terribly from urinary troubles. I ailed all over, suffering
                        from a terrible pressing pain at the top of my head, which made me feel as
                        if it would finally drive me demented; there were also shooting pains in the
                        temples, rheumatic pains, hot flushes and cold chills, and I used to have a
                        dragging, tired feeling which made me disinclined to go out of doors at all
                        of even talk to anybody.</p>
                    <p>"Off and on the doctor treated me for three years, similar attacks coming on
                        all the time then I tired a second doctor, and I at last I made up my mind
                        to see what Doan's Backache Kidney Pills would do for me. I used two boxes
                        and obtained no relief, and began to fear that they would do me no good. But
                        toward the nend of the third box the urine began to pass more freely. After
                        that stones began to come away, at first small, about the size of peas, and
                        after that larger, some of them as large as a small bean. There was great
                        pain while passing them, but otherwise I began to feel much better. In all I
                        passed 60 stones, using the pills for months according to directions. My
                        health has been first-rate ever since. </p>

                    <p>DANGERS OF MODERATE DRINKING</p>
                    <p> The effect of a small daily dose of alcohol on animals is set forth by
                        Professor Taav. LAitinen, of Helsingtors, in a paper laid before the
                        International Anti-Alcohol Congress at Stockholm, of which an account is
                        given by Mr. Theodore Neild in the "British Journal of Inebreity"</p>
                    <p>"Prof. Laitinen began by reminding us that former results which he had from
                        time to time published had been obtained by the administration of larger
                        doses - never less than 0.5 gramme for each kilogramme that the animal in
                        question weighed. He had felt that it was of great importance, however, to
                        try how far the resistivity of animals was effected, and in what directions,
                        when the doses administered each day were so small as 0.1 gramme</p>
                    <p>"The writer, when at Helsingfors, was told by Prof. Laitinen that this amount
                        would mean, in the case of a man of average weight, a glass of Finnish beer
                        daily, and the glass seemed hardly as large as that used in England. In
                        order to detect the influence of these very small does, Prof. Laitinen has
                        kept his research animals - guinea pigs and rabits - in a perfectly equipped
                        place. He employed a large number of animals, and, of course, treated them
                        all alike, even to the handling during the administration of the liquids.
                        The only difference was that some had water alone, and others the same
                        quantity of water with such an amount of alcohol mixed with it as to get 0.1
                        gramme of alcohol per kilogramme of their respective weights. The two sets
                        were treated for eight months. To dect the altercation in resistivity, Dr.
                        Laitien availed himself of the most delicate methods of reseach and
                        biological reactions. In the first place, the resistivity of the animals
                        (the alcoholised animals and the control or non-alcoholised animals were
                        tested either by autoinfection or by inoculation (guinea pigs) with the
                        toxin of diphteria. This showed the alcoholised animals to have less
                        resistivity. The difference was clearly to be recognised. In the case of
                        fourty rabbits exxposed to infecion for four months the lessened immunity
                        was as fourty-five to sixty-five, and where death ensured the duration of
                        disease was as 13.6 to 21.7 days in the alcoholished and control animals
                        respectively. . . .</p>
                    <p>Of the young born of alcoholised rabbits 61.29 per cent. deied and of those
                        born of control animals 54.17 per cent. died. The young of the alcoholished
                        rabbits, when three days old, weighed on a average 79 grammes, and grew
                        during the next twenty days 7.13 grammes daily on an average. The young of
                        those treated with water only, weighed 87.9 grammes at birth, and grew at
                        the rate of 9.46 grammes per diem.</p>
                    <p>The difference is still clearer when we come to the guinea pigs. Of the young
                        of those treated with water alone 21.74 per cent. only died; whilst, on the
                        other hand, the proportion in the case of the alcoholised animals  was 36.76
                        per cent. The progeny of the former weighed at birth on an average 77.31
                        grammes, grew in the first ten days 4.12 grammes daily. The young of the
                        latter - the alcoholised animals- on the other hand, were on an average
                        73.41 grammes at birth, and grew in the first twenty days 4.30 grammes
                        daily. When he carried on his weighings for 110 days the difference was as
                        4.36 grammes to 5.50 grammes. He began with seventy animals and ended with
                        348, having had more than 600 pass through his hands. It constitutes one of
                        the most important reseaches of modern times, and its findings must exercise
                        a great influence upon our attitude towards what is now regarded as the most
                        moderate use of alcohol as a beverage"</p>
