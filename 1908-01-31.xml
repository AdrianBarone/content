                        very old and distinctive guisbed regiment, and possesses a most interesting
                        history The 1st Battalion came into existence in the closing weeks of 1688
                        when the Revolution had changed a dynasty. Pore most amagat the partisans of

                        regiment joined the banner of the Prince at Exeter, and Littrell became its
                        first colonel</p>
                    <p>A nucleus had previously existed in the shape of some independent companies

                        have sufficed for in 1690 we find it in Ireland in William's Army, fighting
                        gallantly at the Boyne and other actions At the death of Luttrell, which
                        abortly followed the Irish campaign, Sir Thomas Erle was appointed to the
                        command, and be brought the regiment to Flanders were it gained laurela at
                        Steenkirk, and Landon and many other actions of the period. Erle rose from a

                        on his men. It distinguished itself at the siege of Namur and can home to

                        when, at any rate, a part of it joined Marl borough's army in time to share
                        in the famous victory at Malplaquet (11th September, 1709) At the storming
                        of Douay it suffered loss. It was also at Bouchain It was predominantly
                        engaged, likewise, at Pouta Vendin, and in other actions in Marlborough's
                        campaigns After the peace of l'tracht the regiment was many years at home
                        About this time, from</p>
                    <p>1738 to 1748, it was commanded by Chas Howard, second son of the third Earl
                        of Carlisle, and one of George the Second's "captains. Having green facings,
                        it became known is the "Green Howarda," to distinguish it from the Bafts,
                        which were then known as "Howard's" after their colonel. George Howard, who
                        commanded that regiment for a long period. The regimental connection with
                        Yorkshire probably commenced at this time, although the regiment did not
                        receive its county title until 1782</p>
                    <p>In 1774, the Regiment went to Flanders and there made a name for itself in
                        many bard fought actions notably at Fontenoy, where the British were basely
                        deserted by their Datch allies Roucoux, Val, etc.against six times their own
                        numbers. It was whilst on this service that fifes were first introduced in
                        the Britsb service and the Green Howards were the first to use that musical
                        instrument At the outbreak of the Seven Years War it raised a second
                        battalion, which was formed into the 66th Foot, and is now the 2nd Royal
                        Berkshire Regiment late at Alexandria The 19th, the regiment now began to be
                        called, took a prominent part in the famous siege and capture of Belle Isle,
                        outbe coast of Brittany, in 1761; and subsequently was stationed at
                        Gibraltar, whence it returned home in 1771 It went out to Charlestown,
                        Carolina 11 1781, and was present in the wins at Monks Corney, the relief of
                        Port Ninety Six, and the action at Eutaw Springs, and went through much
                        harassing work up to the departure of the troopa and "loyalista" in
                        December, 1782, when it removed to Barbadoen, and ultimately to Jamaica,
                        where it remained until 1791 At the outbreak of the French war the regiment
                        formed part of the expedition which cooperate with the French Royalists at
                        Quiberoni, and afterwards landed at Ostend. It served the campaign of 1794
                        under the Duke of York, and shared in the disastrous winter retreat through
                        Holland and West</p>

                    <p>Ceylon. A detachment of five companies was sent to Madras in 1799, and took
                        part in the capture of Seringspatam These companies were intended to
                        accompany Baird's expedition np the Red Sea to Egypt, but instead went back
                        to Ceylon. The regiment was employed at Kandy at various times, the massacre
                        of one of its detachments, in 103, Wu of the most tragic character. The
                        regiment was employed for some time in the Travancore district, and sent
                        four companies to Isle Rodriguez, which took part in the capture of
                        Mauritins (Isle of France, in 1810 It was also engaged in the Kandyan War of
                        1817 18 19, returning home in 1820, after twenty three years continuous
                        service in Ceylon and the Past ludice It served in Demerara and the West
                        Indies from 1826 to 1836, and in Malta, the louian Islands, the West Indies,
                        and North America from 1840 to 1850.</p>

                        war and earned new laurels at the Battle of Alma where it suffered

                        files opposed to it. Three companies rendered invaluable service in enabling
                        General Codrington to hold the celebrated "Victoria Ridgo throughout the

                        the quelling of the Mutiny, remaining in India till 1872, during which
                        period further bonours were won in the Hazarda Expedition and the operations
                        against the warrior tribes of the Black Mountain, gaining the thanks and
                        praise of the Viceroy of India. The second battalion w wided to the regiment
                        in 183 In 1881 the old number was discarded and the regi ment received the
                        designation of the Princess of WalenYorkshire Regiment Three years later,
                        the 1st battalion was engaged in the Nile expedition, and the subsequent

                        of Ginnin. Two years were spent on the banks of the Nile, and no battalion
                        could wish for a harder time than fell to their lot in the waste of sand. In
                        1999 when the Boer War wm looming the 1st Battalion was recalled home from
                        Gibraltar and rapidly mobilised for active service. It embarked for the Cape

                        Atter a month's hard fighting in the Colesberg distriot the battalion joined
