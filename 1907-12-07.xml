                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's
                        “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                        Dyspeptics, Invalids and the Aged. In the sick-room it will be found
                        invaluable and it is easily and quickly made, the addition of boiling water

                <div type="section"><head>Sir Eldon Gorst</head>
                    <p>Included in a house party assembled in the Eastern Counties some
                        two-and-twenty years ago was a young man who entered with spirit into all
                        the amusements of a very gay week. There was a county ball in the
                        neighbouring town, besides dancing and amusements of all kinds in the
                        country house itself. Of these gaieties the young man in question was the
                        life and soul. Few of those who formed that house party in the mid-eighties
                        foresaw the eminence to which their fellow-guest would attain, though many
                        were struck with the brilliance of his conversation and the pungency of bis
                        wit. One or two predicted for him a great future.</p>
                    <p>These last were in the right for Eldon Gorst has in these twenty-odd years
                        risen to quite a dazzling height in the service of his country. It was just
                        after the house party in question that he first entered the Foreign Office,
                        at the age of twenty-four. He had, it is true, certain preliminary
                        advantages that stood him in good stead. The son of a distinguished father
                        for even at that time Sir John Gorst was SolicitorGeneral, and in the
                        following year be became under-Secretary for India--Eldon Gorst had been
                        educated at Eton, and had gone thence to Trinity College, Cambridge, whence
                        he emerged twentieth wrangler. Yet these are advantages shared by many who
                        elect to make diplomacy their profession. It was this young man's own
                        personality that so soon made its mark, leading him on through the various
                        grades of attached, third Secretary and second Secretary, until he became in
                        the year 1890, a very important personage as Controller of Direct Taxes to
                        the Egyptian Government. Here was an opening that gave soope for the
                        brain-power that Nature had given Mr. Eldon Gorst in no scant measure. In
                        two years be became Under-Secretary of State for Finance, and two years
                        later came to him the post of Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior. These
                        important offices brought their holder, of course, into close relations with
                        Lord Cromer, whose understudy he became and that so successfully that five
                        years ago 8 grateful Government improved plain Mr. Bldon Gorst into Sir
                        Eldon Gorst by bestowing on him a Civil K.C.B. It is only during the present
                        year, however, that the clever young diplomat of twenty years ago attained
                        to the highest reward that comes of long service in Egypt. Lord Cromer, from
                        motives of health and because of advancing years, last spring elected to
                        retire from his responsible position in Cairo. Who so fit to succeed him as
                        Sir Eldon Gorst, trained for so many years under his watchful eye ? So the
                        man of the moment was there at the moment, and now, at the age of
                        thirty-six, finds himself the deus ex machina of all the complicated network
                        of Egyptian affairs.</p>
                    <p>Even his most ardent admirers will not be disposed to consider Sir Eldon
                        Gorst particularly imposing in his personal appearance. He is quite
                        unusually short, as the men of these days go, with rather a stoop of the
                        shoulders, and short sight necessitates his wearing pince-nez at all times
                        and seasons. Yet his is an exceedingly clever face, and the eyes, even
                        through their spectacles, have a merry, bright twinkle that shows a keen
                        sense of humor. In former days no one entered more keenly into the social
                        gaieties of Cairo, and Mr. Gorst, as he then was, in spite of being a man ot
                        affairs, managed to be at all the amusing pienio parties, balls, and dinners
                        of the winter season in Egypt. Four years ago, however, having waited till
                        he was well over forty, Sir Eldon settled down to matrimony; he wooed and
                        won the daughter of a well-known South African financier, Mr. Charles Rudd,
                        and their wedding in Lancaster Gate was one of the events of the season of
                        1903. Lady Gorst is a very ebarining and popular lady, who will do the
                        honours of the British Consulate-General with much of the grace that made
                        her predecessor, Lady Cromer, 80 well liked during these last five seasons
                        at Cairo. To complete the good fortune of Sir Eldon Gorst-to whom, surely,
                        the gods have been extraordinarily kind-there is a young hopeful, who has
                        just accompanied Lady Gorst to Egypt, and will, no doubt, in time carry on
                        the traditions of a specially talented family to the third generation.-(From
                        "The World" Egypt Supplement.)</p></div>
