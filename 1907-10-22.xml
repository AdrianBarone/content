                    <p>I hereby certify that I have taken samples of every vatting of <hi
                            rend="bold">Mackie's White Horse Celler</hi> Blend of Scotch Whisky used
                        in bottling during the month of September, and the results of my analyses
                        indicate that it conforms to the standard for Pot Still Scotch Whisky set up
                        in the London case. I am also of opinion that it is an old Whisky of
                        excellent quality and flavour, which has been well matured in wood.</p>

                            the Japanese, he points out that the attempt of white labour to stem the
                            yellow flood is a mere inevitable expression of the instinct of self.
                            preservation.</p>
                        <p>Japanese immigration must either be restrict ed or unrestricted, he says.
                            The former course means serious diplomatic difficulty at Tokio. The
                            latter coarse means an absolutely fatal feud with Australian and
                            Canadian democracy. If Japanese immigration is not restricted the
                            Japanese will be in great majority in British Columbia in leas than a
                            decade. British white labour would be simply submerged by the yellow
                            flood :—</p>
                        <p>The colony might remain for a time under the British flag, bat would
                            ultimately cease to be in any sense a British colony. In the long ran
                            there would be a racial war, and either British Columbia would become
                            part of the United States, or the Japanesewould maintain their footing
                            upon the Pacific slope under their own flag.</p>
                        <p>It is absolutely certain that with unrestrict ed immigration California
                            in twenty years would be a Japanese State, inhabited by « white minority
                            :-—</p>
                        <p>The unrestricted influx of yellow immigrants would create along the
                            Pacific strip of North America an Asiatic Chili. The conditions of the
                            whole American problem would be gradu- ally but funadmentally
                            transformed. The most destractive of all imaginable solvents would be
                            applied to the Monroe doctrine. Asiatics would hold both sides of the
                            Pacific, as Buropeans hold both sides of the Atlantic, and all
                            civilisation might be dominated or convalsed for centaries hy that state
                            of things, as the Middle Ages were moved and vitalised by the secalar
                            conflict between Christendom and Islam.</p>
                        <p>Summing up, he concludes that for all pur poses of this generation the
                            dangers of an norestricted Asiatic invasion are too great. It will not
                            be allowed. He fully admits the diffi culty of inducing the Japanese to
                            accept a position of inequality internationally equivilant to the
                            medieval status of the Jews : —</p>
                        <p>The Japanese have, perhaps, yet to realise, as their acquaintance with
                            the West becomes more familiar and their knowledge of it more subtle,
                            that all Earopean political arrange ments, except where the direct issue
                            is war, are based upon illogical but convenient com promise must be the
                            foundation of any tempor ary settlement.</p>
                        <p>Some middle course mast be found, for :—</p>
                        <p>Atsolate exclusion of the yellow race from all the enormous anfilled
                            territories claimed as white man's country would mean war. Bat the
                            unrestricted invasion would lead even more certainly to war in a worse
                            form. No one is justified in taking an optimistic view of this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>A truly unpleasant dilemma likely to tax the patience and wisdom of
                            statesmen for many a year to come.</p>

                        <p>One of the most interesting of recent disco- veries in Egypt is a huge
                            marble head of Juno, its face absolutely uninjared, which was found near
                            Hawara in the oasis of the Fayoum. It is almost certainly of the early
                            Roman period, as there are abundant traces of Greek influence. The head
                            was obviously made separately and fitted on to the colossal statue after
                            the latter was erected ; it is 17 in. from the base ot the neck to the
                            crown of the head, and 12 im. wide at tho brow. It is one of the most
                            beautiful Roman heads that has yet been discovered in Egypt</p>

                            several years this hotel bas held a foremost place among the hostelries
                            of Ramleh, and it well sustains the-popularity which it gained during
                            the earlier years of its existence. When taken over by the Runkewitz
                            Brothers every possible improvement was effected and the hotel now
                            boasts the finest garden in Alexandria, a cuisine which cannot be
                            excelled, and a general instal- ment equal to any hotel in Egypt. The
                            service of the hotel is all that could be desired, its bedrooms are not
                            only airy but also luxuriously farnished, and private suites can be

                            proprietors of Egypt, and from among the many British clients of note

                    <head>THE LAMBERT AFFAIR.</head>
                    <p>MR. DUNLOP AND HIS ACCUSERS.</p>
                    <p>FRENCH AND EGYPTIANS.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dunlop, so the world, or rather M. Lambert and the three “Standards,”
                        would have as believe inflicted severe injuries on the dignity of the
                        ex-Director of the Khedivial Law School, compelling him as we pointed out to
                        join in a conspiracy against the Minister of Education and to commit a
                        variety of mean- neases—nasty tricks at which the Great Karamel blushes for
                        shame. Indeed, if we are to believe the excellent jurist, Mr. Dunlop merits
                        something more than dismissal ; indeed it would seem doubtful ir the
                        gallotine— pardon we meant the gallows—were not too good an end for his
                        misspent life. For all the treasures on earth, including those gathered from
                        the subscriptions of the faithful to the three “Standards,” we would not
                        stand in Mr. Dunlop's shoes.</p>
                    <p>The ex-Director of the Law School, knowing the strong national spirit of his
                        compatriots, gives it to be clearly understood that one of the chief reasons
                        of his resignation was the impossibility for a Frenchman to co-operate with
                        a scheming and treacherous British chief. Any other action on his part would
                        have com- promised the prestige of France. The children of perfidious
                        Albion’ must be left to their national vices of treachery and lying. M.
                        Lambert who combines the qualities of a diplomat and of a jurist, has in his
                        letter, doubtless destined to be historic, appealed to the Chauvinism of a
                        section of his countrymen. Paris was indignant when she heard of the
                        disgraceful conduct of Mr. Dunlop and certain journals seemed about to call
                        upon the Govern ment to denounce the “‘entente cordiale,” which benefited
                        England and England only. Perbaps the most uncomfortably situated Frenchmen
                        were the aediles of Paris. It is averred, by M. Lambert's friends, that they
                        all but refused to go to London to empty numerous magnums and enlivened by
                        the communicative warmth of the banquet to shed tears on the Lord Mayor's
                        shirt tront.</p>
                    <p>Why did the ex-Director of the Law School, whose amour-propre was almost
                        excessive, consent for months to be the Adviser's tool ! His case is a
                        matter, not for the alienists as some declare, but for the onomatologists to
                        quote in support of theirtheories. Who are the onomatologists | Persons who
                        assert, with the confidence of the devotees of palmistry, that they can read
                        a man's character, virtues, vices and all, in his Christian name or in one
                        of his Christian names, ‘Paul,’ for example, any Paul you please, will be
                        like the Apostle, energetic, quick tempered, a trifle hasty, and given to
                        sudden changes of ideas, ‘conversions’ shall we say. Mr. Edonard Pan!
                        Lambert cer tainly inspires us with some confidence in the ingenious
                        hypothesis of M. de Rochetal. It certainly explains the ‘volte face,’ the
                        contri bation to the leading journal of that ‘anti European’ movement which
                        once caused Mr. Lambert such pain. As to the nature of Mr Lambeft's
                        action—well —we can only emend Mme. Roland's dying apostrophe to Liberty and
                        exclaim ‘Patriotism, what stupidities are committed in thy name.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the Director General of the Reli gious and Patriotic Monopoly has
                        been swift to seize the chance offered by Mr. Lambert's misfortunes and
                        aparring on Rosinante, rides full tilt not at the windmills which felled his
                        illustrious predecessor but at Mr. Dunlop and perfidious Albion</p>
                    <p>Really the Pasha is rather an ungrateful young man—seeing that it is to the
                        British Occupation that he owes his magnificent and enviable situation of
                        exploiter of the Egyptian public which he fills with a rare competence. It
                        is thanks tothe British Ocenpation too that he may one day become Khedive of
                        Egypt or at least Resident of the Bahr el Ghazal</p>
                    <p>His press campaign violent as it is, is not enough, for a flourish of
                        trampets in the three Standards anohnees a “Great Speech” at Alex andria. We
                        are hippy to be able to give some of its most striking passages in advance.

                        throne...... Perfi dious Albion end again “Patriotism Parliament” etc. The
                        Great Karamel, musician in his inmost soul, has based his oratorical stile
                        on the perambulant organ. At all events we may be sure that the Zizinia
                        theatre will be full on Oct. 22, and that the imperial guard, recruited from
                        the Sharia el Dawaween will applaud the delivery of every phrase of a
                        carefully dictated and polished harangue, and will bear the hero in triamph
                        on their shoulders at its close. Had we any influence with the bowab of the
                        Palace of Don Quixote II, we should arge him to remind his master that the
                        claqne deserve something for their pains, for is not this Ramadan! Perhaps
                        they have received their reward. Do not the friends of “oor Director”
                        whisper that he in » moment of expansion told an intimate friend under the
                        seal of secrecy that the French are the friends of every oppressed race and
                        showed their generosity by a little present of 30,000 francs The friend
                        whispered and the public believed and marvelled—why | That is the question
                        but if the tale be true we are sorry for M. Cailloux who with the budget
                        nicely balanced sees his colleagne at the Quay d'Orsay handing over soms
                        that might have relieved some of the victims of the floods of the Midi. But
                        perhaps the Pasha’s friends are as imaginative as is his bodyguard of
                        gladiatorial journalists and vebe- ment law students. It is more probable
                        certainly</p>

                        given abundant proofs of honesty and courgae. His romantic descriptions of
                        Mr. Dunlop's conspi- racies are accepted without hestitation really, and if
                        the ex-Director of the Law School had des- cribed the assassination of
                        recalcitraunt students by Mr. Dunlop's orders in the groves of the Esbekieh
                        garden, we believe that our excellent confrére the “Egyptian Standard” would
                        have called upon the public to dig up the flower beds and look under the
                        band-stand. And the worst of it all is that these 'advocates of educa- tion’
                        are doing Egypt all the harm in the world by attackingMr. Dunlop's personal
                        character and by accepting M. Lambert's romances as if either had any
                        bearing on the real question that is before the public "How can education be
                        advanced in Egypt?" What Egypt requires is intelligence character. The
                        country is not likely to obtain these blessing if its most intelligent sons
                        spend their time in discussing the Advisor's mysterious villaninies, deride
                        critics who seek to infuse a little common sense into their enthusiasm and
                        devite themselves to personalities rather than constructive cri- ticism.
                        Many of us Europeans are of opinion that educational progress in Egypt has
                        not kept pace with the material develop: ment of the country but when we aré
                        told that Europeans can know nothing of the real needs of the people and
                        that Egyp- tians must beallowed te work out theirown salva- tion, we reply
                        ‘la parole est à vous Messieurs’ and wait expectantly for edncational
                        paténts from various newspaper offices, for practical suggestions and a
                        constructive programme. What is the result—instead of giving us hints as to
                        the improvement of the secondary school course “Al Lewa” with vast
                        complacency cites the names of several local geniuses who once upon a time
                        taught algebra or political economy through the medium of Arabic, instead of
                        telling us what the Khedivial Law School must do to be saved : so to speak,
                        the “Egyptian Standard” triumphantly informs us that Mr. Dunlop has a
                        dreadful past, was a missionary and played upon the organ. Happily our
                        contemporary for once in a way forgot the obvious and spared us the parallel
                        of Nero fiddling while Rome burned and a painful picture of Mr. Dunlop
                        pulling out a fresh stop as each Egyptian applicant was cast from the doors
                        by his unwilling accomplice, Otherwise there is nothing for which we need be
                        thankful ; personalities continue to descend like manna. Even the poets have
                        been infected by the prevailing mania. Hafiz Ibrahim must now be playing at
                        ‘boyaghi’, and after blacken- ing Lord Cromer's charcter and that of Mr.
                        Dunlop puts a dash of blacking on Sir Eldon Gorst’s boots.</p>
                    <p>M. Lambert might have at least given some clearer indications of what, in his
                        opinion, the Law School required.</p>
                    <p> But all he has to say on the subject amounts to this, that French is doomed
                        as a go- vernmental language in Egypt and that the French School of Law has
                        to be developed. Of the new situation created by the immense increase of the
                        English side at the expense of the French in the secondary schools be has
                        nothing to say worth onr attention. He has failed to point out the real
                        difficulty —that the budding lawyers, members of the Parquet arrive at the
                        Law School innocent of French with the result that they must learn a French
                        legal system through the medium of English, a language practically never
                        heard in the Mixed and useless in the Native Tribunals. We venture to
                        suggest that the only real escape from the impasse is to increase the Arabic
                        speaking staff, retaining such European professors as are masters of any
                        particular branch of law and can lec ture in English or French but giving
                        every pupil a chance of obtaining a good legal grounding in his
                        mother-tongue. Once this system is in force it matters little whether the
                        director of the Law School is English or French, or whether Mr. Dunlop was
                        really a missionary or not. As for the question of discipline etc, we agree
                        that it was too rigid, and we cannot help thinking that if Mr. Dunlop had
                        left the Law School a little more independent matters would have gone
                        better. Meanwhile the chief centre of higher education in Egypt seems
                        destined to become the focus of the anti-European ideas which Mr. Lambert
                        says that he deplores, and the public reads a new penny dreadful “Dunlop the
                        Destroyer — or the Conrageous Professor and His Tyrant Chief.”

                        will be glad to avail themselves of these sailings. The rates Messrs. Thos.

                    <p>On Saturday the 5th inst. at St. Paul's Church, Wimbledon Park, the marriage
                        took place of Captain Charles Massie Blomfield, elder son of Rear-Admiral
                        Sir Massie and Lady Blomfield of Alexandria, Egypt, and Miss Hirell
                        Clarence, elder daughter of Mrs. Clarence of Castle Towers, Wimbledon

                        Charles Brooke, godfather of the bridegroom.</p>
                    <p>The bride, who was given away be her uncle, Mr. Porter Rhodes, was a gown of
                        soft white satin, the corsage exquisitely embriodered in white and palest
                        shade of pink. Her tulle viel over a wreath of organge blossoms was
                        arranaged so taht it fell softly over the trained skirt. Her only ornament
                        was a necklace of pearls.</p>

                        pattern, finely embriodered with gold thread. In their dark green satin hats
                        hung a rich cavalier plume. The shoes were of dark Morocco, and the bouquets
                        of roses of a deep shade of yellow were tied with green ribbon. The
                        bridegroom's gifts to them were gold and white enamel bracelets with
                        amethysts. Mr. Hugh Blomfield, brother of the bridegroom, acted as best

                        a few small Arab youths greeted him.</p>

                            be reason- able enough in its demand for a month's pay as bonus. The

                            granting the request. Promotio, by the way, is granted to the favoured
