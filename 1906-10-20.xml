                        SATURDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1906
                        THE METRIC SYSTEM According to Reuter's telegram of Thursday, the adoption of the metric Nystem by the firm of Messrs. Kynoch Limited, of whose board Mr. Arthur Chamberlain is chairman, has fallen as a bomb upon the commercial world of Great Britain. Mr. Chamberlain expresses the opinion that the firm is only anticipating
                        general reformation which must soon come in England, and mys that they are thereby reducing the cost of their calculations and in creasing their export trade. The telegram, however, does not make clear to what ettent the metric system (in the literal and original meaning of the word "metric") has been adopted. A few years ago "metric" system was suggested with an inch unit as basis, and we remain in ignorance as to whether the firm has adopted the inch or the metre unit. No worse method for weighing and measuring than the one which has held sway in England for centuries could be conceived, and scientists were long since compelled to discard it and base all their calculations upon the infinitely more rational metric system. That system has stood the test of use satisfactorily, whereas ours has proved most clumsy and detrimental to our trade with foreign countries. The general adoption of the metric system into our country could be effected with very little cost and labour were the inch to be taken as the unit of length, but the entire changing of the inch unit would be very costly and a great obstrue. tion to the introduction of the more scientific system. Assuming, therefore, that we are about to adopt the metric system, which we should have done very many years ago.--the question still remains, what shall we take as our unit ! A uniformity of systems and units would greatly simplity interchange of trade between us and other countries, but can it be obtained? There are indeed two methods by which such a consommation could be reached. The first, and the one to which we incline the more readily, is that the inch unit should be adopted in the metric system, and that the some 550,000,000 people who use it should force the 150,000,000 people who use the metre unit to adopt the former. The second method is the adoption of the metre as a length unit by Greater Britain, which would be a terrific sacrifice. It is not the adoption of the metrie system which would prove a diffi culty, but the adoption of the metre length unit. The clumsinesss and impractibility of our systems of calculations are universally recognised, and reform is, therefore, greatly to be desired, but we would hardly counsel the adoption of the metre unit. A nation who divides a square pole into thirty and a quarter square yards, who follows such a system of recording temperatures, the bare mention of which makes a scientist shud. nder, indeed whose every mathematical calcula. tion is ridiculously laborious, must be content to run an uneven race. It behoves us, there. fore, to adopt the general decimal system used by other countries.
                        Up to 1897 the irregular and arbitrary nature of the British standards was enforced by law, but in August of that year Parlia ment sanctioned the use of the metric system, which up to the present no British firm has been sufficiently courageous to adopt. In the metrie system there are five principal units, those of length, ares, volume, capacity, and weight. The unit of length is the metre; the unit of area is the square metre; the unit of volume is the cubic metre; the unit of capacity is the litre, which is one-tenth of a metre ; and the unit of weight is a gram, i.e. the weight of water contained in one-thousandth of litre. Such is the system which we ought to adopt, with the exception that the inch should take the place of the metre. The whole system is based upon a single measurement of length and from it we can find out by simple calculation the weight of known volumes of different substances. But the English system has the dis advantage of being variable as well as arbitrary, as is instanced by the existence of two hundred different weights for weighing corn, as an example of which we might note that 46 Sutherland pounds of an equal 240 Cornish pounds. Lord Kelvin denounced the English system as time wasting and brain-destroying in its confusions, and we heartily agree with him. These are not the only disadvantages, Many firms have to spend hundreds of pounds
                        year in the necessary transcription of English weights and measures to the metrical system mnd vice versá, and, moreover, England is continually losing orders owing to her bad system, In many,and probably in the majority of cases, the prices of competing firms differ very little, and the question of convenience invulved in che use or non-use of the metric system may easily decide who gets the order.

                        Ales "Al Watan" says : No one has yet oriticised Lord Cromer like this original Bogliabman, the A fevered eccentrio, Mr. Wilfred Blont. No one with bas attacked bim with soch violence and vigour. I will Some Egyptians regard Mr. Blant as an intellectual phenomenon. The majority regard him as an oddity, and as being incapable of giving any advice that can be accepted with profit. The batred and malice of this strange personage have led him at last to write an article to the Figaro" containing a scandalous ber. personal attack on Lord Cromer. Tbe latter, ope! according to Mr. Blant, bas always aimed at and annexation by devious and unworthy intrigue. five Our readers can be trusted to form their own opinion of this writer. He is simply ad eccentric, for whose opinions and literary productions merit tipe Do consideration wbatever. The very extravag | anoe of his opslaaghts can only be of ad vantage to Lord Cromer, who returns to Egypt stronger than before.

                        This well-known farcica! oomedy was given last night to a well-filled house and provod. great attraction. It is an extremely fanny play, the situation at times being very cleverly arranged, though in some CHAOS somewhat wb risquée, and might not be appreciated by an car Eoglish aodience. All the same everybody fee neamed bigbly pleased with the piece, and the audience went away in the best of bomours.
                        We must oonfoss to having bad some doubts as to the Gardet company being op to the average, jodging from a visit we paid to this theatre shortly after their arrival, but we have no hesitation in saying that the company last night showed vast improvement on the previous efforts, besides being strengthened by the addi. tion of a most valuable recruit in the person of Mlle. Berthe Chantepay, who is a host in berself. She actod and sang admirably throughout, ber impersonation of the leading part being well nigh perfect. She favoured us with . couple of songs doring the segond not which called forth loud applause, though we are oortain that half the audience did not grasp the meaning of the se sond one, consisting mostly of Parisian slang; albeit it appeared to groatly am use those who onderstood.
