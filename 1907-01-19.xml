                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed to
                        Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel accommodation
                        for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr. Najem Houry
                        proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent
                        Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to
                        Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
                        Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                        Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                        begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                        Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                        scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                        in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>THE CAPITULATIONS.</head>
                    <p>The recent pronouncement of the Italian Chamber of Commerce on the proposed
                        modification of the Capitluations appears to us to have been based either on
                        an erroneous version or on a misundertstanding of Lord Cromer's propsoals as
                        set forth in his report for 1905. It was never the intention of the great
                        statesman who has so long and so brilliantly represented the British Empire
                        in Egpt to hand over the members of the European colonies in Egypt to the
                        tender mercies of entirely native</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>Courts. Indeed any such intention was openIly disclaimed by H.B.M.'s Agent,
                        and while we are very ready to acknowledge the attractions of a policy of
                        marking time in regard to the Capitulations we cannot see that Con.
                        servatism of this sort is likely in the long run to benefit the country.
                        Even granting that the Capitulations question is temporarily shelved, it is
                        bound to be brought up again, and in our opinion ita reappearance may quite
                        conceivably be connected with revival of Nationalist agitation. Thus far, it
                        is true, the extreme wing of the Egyptian Nationalist party has, if
                        anything, opposed Lord Cromer's schemes and rather Daively defended its
                        action on the ground that the removal of the international check-however
                        harmful its continued existence to the best interests of Egypt would allow
                        the British Government freer hand to the greater deltiment-according to the
                        journalistic mouthpieces of the above-mentioned party-of Egypt and the
                        Egyptians. We do not, of course, share this view, but we should like to
                        point out that, under certain conditions which can easily be imagined, a
                        demand for the abolition of the Capitulations might become very important
                        "plank" in the Nationalist platform of the future, "Surely it would be more
                        prudent for the critics of the proposed modifications to take this
                        possibility into account. </p>
                    <p>But, abandoning hypotheses as to the future, to what do the suggestions of
                        Lord Cromer amount ? Simply to the absorption by Britain of the
                        Capitulations. Our correspondent "Africa nus" pointed this out in an able
                        letter which we published in our issue of Monday, and added that some
                        species of guarantee of the permanency of the British Occupation would be
                        demanded by the European population of Egypt before its individual members
                        consented to forego the rights which they now possess. This criticism
                        undoubtedly goes to the root of the whole matter. Our policy in Egypt is
                        based-and, we may add, can only be justifiably based on the assumption that
                        we are here as instructors who have agreed to leave the school when the
                        pupils have given proofs of their ability to make their own way in the
                        world. How, then, can we give any guarantee of the permanence of our
                        occupation 1 Our agreeement with France does not appreciably alter the
                        situation. By its provisions we are committed to a self-denying policy as
                        regards changes in the political situation of the country, while our
                        political predominance therein is at the same time admitted. We are
                        therefore debarred, to a self-denying policy as regards changes in the
                        political situation of the country, while our political predominance therein
                        is at the same time admitted. We are therefore debarred, on the one band,
                        from declaring &amp; protectorato of the country (we assume, of course, the
                        nonoccurrence of any political cataclysm), and, on the other, we are bound
                        by our promises and the whole tenor of our administration to work for the
                        realisation of the formula "Egypt for the Egyptians," however long we may
                        have to wait till the country is ripe for self-government, </p>
                    <p>If it be assumed that the provisions of the Anglo-French Agreement do not
                        deal with the difficulty to which we have alluded is it not possible for
                        some formula to be discovered by French and British statesmen which will
                        solve the dilemma without any infraction of the Anglo-French Agreement or of
                        our obliga tions towards Egypt 1 We require formula which will explicitly
                        assert the continuance of the political bond between Great Britain and Egypt
                        without in the least prejudicing the de facto rights of the former country
                        to grant to the latter, it and when it becomes ripe for it, a greater
                        measure of internal freedom from foreign control. In brief can Egypt for the
                        Egyptians" be reconciled with the demand of our correspondent for a
                        guarantee of the per manency of the Oocupation </p>
                    <p>That Egypt is not yet ripe for self-govern ment is our firm conviction, and,
                        despite the eloquence of certain orators and journalists, we cannot believe
                        that we shall ourselves see the day when Egyptians will be entirely able to
                        dispense with foreign advice as to the management of their own affairs. But
                        if and when that day comes, what is to be our position! Are we to abandon
                        Egypt to the Turk or to the tender mercies of any ambitious Power with a
                        taste for foreign advonture! Be the future Egyptian Government never so
                        pacific, never so liberal, it must incur with all weak States a fatal
                        liability to foreign aggression, and we shall have played Egypt a sorry
                        trick if we abandon her to the mercy of tho first comér. Again, there is the
                        strategical question-can we, can any Power with Great Eastern interests ever
                        be indifferent to the future of the State which will one day owa the Suez
                        Canal ! But we are plunging into the slough of speculative welt-politik.
                        Enough that we have given with all diffidence our interpretation of a very
                        complex situation. </p>

                        <p>The recent encounter between Draser and Bedouins in the Vilayet of Syria
                            appears to bave been of a very serijos nature, the loss of life being
                            far more heavy than is usually the osno in inter-tribal warfare. The
                            skilfol tactics and straight shooting of the Droses appear to bave
                            completely rooted their opponents, who were doubtless inore than
                            sorprised to find their obargos received with saob remarkable stendiDesa
                            by the bill men. The Horan Druses, it may be remembered, gave the
                            Turkish Government and its Bedouin and Cirosasian allies considerable
                            trouble io 1894. Their nombers! bave inoreased since ther, and they are
                            now extremely we'l armed with Martini and maga sine rifles. </p>
                        <p>During the frontier dispate the Turkish forces in Syria were inereased
                            mainly by drafts from he Vth Army Corps and a considerable pomber of man
                            dispatched to Akabs vd Ma'au. Nope tbe less the Turkish forces in the
                            Vilayeta of Beyroat, Aleppo, and Damasoos did not by any means reach the
                            imposing total of 80,000 men given by Mokhtar Pasha, and the constant
                            drafte of Syrian conscripts to Yemen and Macedonia must have caused a
                            fortber dimination of effe stives. The 9ib Division of the Nizim is now
                            at Series in Baropean Turkey, wbile over 20 battalioor of infantry were
                            dispatched in 1904 and 1905 to the seat of war in Arsbia, to retara with
                            the strength of companies or never to return at all. </p>
                        <p>It is this military weakness of the central goveroment that may explain
                            the signs of onrest pow visible in the Haurda, bat there is no reason to
                            expect this weakness to be of loog continuanoe. Toe connection of the
                            Aleppo line with the main Tarkish railway system, which will probably be
                            completed in the next few years, appears to us as certain to be follow
                            ed by an inorense of the garrison of the vilayet. </p>

                            arrested, and are about to be embarked on a steamer here for Odonsa.
                            Telegrams were dispatched yesterday to Lord Cromer asking his Lordship
                            to intercede in the matter, and "in the name of the humanitarian
                            principles and constant liberal doctrine of England" to prevent the

                            having made preparations to blow up Russian trading vessel in the port
                            of Alexandria. If, says his Lordship, investigations show that they are
                            Russian subjects they will be handed over to their consular anthorities,
                            who of course have every right to deal with them according to the laws

                        <p>A considerable sum of gold, amounting to over £370,000, is being exported
                            by the National Bank of Egypt and the other Egyptian banks to London. We
                            understand that it has been earmarked at the Bank of England for account
                            of the lodis Couvoil, and we have good reasons for believing that the
                            Egyptian banks naturally did not part with the gold except at the market

                            particularly evident by the fact, which an important school of political
                            economista invariably demand me the basis of national wealth, that
                            exports exceed imports by LB. 866,485, which means, in the balance sheet

                        <byline>To The EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE." </byline>
                        <p>Sir,- I am pleased to learn by the letter of "Another Old Resident" ia
                            your issue of yesterday that this important subject is being taken ap by
                            your readers. The sobeme suggested by him for the introduction of Goane:
                            servants might serve to meet the demand for deceat servants at
                            1848onable rates of pay, and I feel sure that were it possit le to
                            engage such 1. class in Egypt there would be plety of applicants for
                            their services. The diffi sulty lies chiefly in establishing the
                            organisation for bringing them into the country, and this in the onse of
                            most private persone would be extreme. Would it be possible to invoke
                            the aid of a British Chamber of Commerce to arrange for the importation
                            of such servants : A part from the above schemes and any servants tbat
                            might tbereby come to this country, we most of course remain in as great
                            measure de pendent on the native for domestic service, and surely it is
                            inoumbent on the Governmen', wbieb looks after the comfort of its
                            officials to the extent of supplying some of them with private
                            residences, to recognise its responsibi. lity in this matter. What is
                            impossible for private individuals is comparatively easy for a
                            Government Administration, and there is nothing to prevent the drafting
                            of sbort deeree to enact that every native servant in the service of a
                            Biropean must be registered under penalty of a fide, to be increased in
                            a reogrrence of an offence against the regulation. Besides tegistration
                            of names every now place entered or left would have to be note 1, with
                            any remarks necessary. Masters would aid the system by Advising the
                            registry offi e of the cessation of their employment of a servant and
                            might give the reasons of his leaving. </p>
                        <p>These are, of course, merely suggestions : the details of the scheme
                            would have to be worked out by the competent legal offiers of the
                            Government. </p>
                        <p>Such a system of registration would not be attended with the elements of
                            odiom and disgrace which are connected with the Anthropometrioal Bureau.
                            The fees payable on registration would probably make the offi se
                            self-supporting, and it could be included in the Budget of any of the
                            minor administra tione, Booh as the Slavery epartment, whose officers
                            would doubtless bellad to spa e from the time allotted to the discharge

                            rooms and wide cellars capacious enough to stand a siege. Kitobeds and
                            bothers' shop, vegetable app, separate seallerier, refrigerators, linen
                            room, oto., all byilt to role and in accordance with most up-to-date
                            requirements. On the same floor, too, are many bedrooms aud bandsome
                            sunny apartments for the use of ladies' msida and valets as well as the
                            dining-room accommodation for those employed upon the staff. </p>
                        <p>The entrance hall is in the centre of the building and from it leads the
                            wide marble staircase to the upper floor. Another large lounge leads
                            also out of it, but well away from draught, and where it er joys the
                            foll b'r za of the sun through its enormous windows. The music room and
                            ladies' drawing-room are also on this for, the former giving on to a
                            wide expanse of terreos at the back. The handsome restaurant with its
                            large windows locks over the river, and the reading and waiting rooms
                            have also the Fame view and the same luxurious English fireplaces. </p>
                        <p>One wing on his floor is devoted to bedroom accommodation, and to every
                            third the room is a most complete bath and toilet room; while at the end
                            of the long corridor is a well planned private suite of apartments,
                            including beacons entrance ball, saloor, and three or four good
                            bedrooms. Similar private suites are to be found at either end of the
                            corridors on the upper floors; and there are two most luxurious buites
                            for princely visitors, ove over the entrance, and one at the back of the
                            hotel, both of which own roomy terraces and every convenience that
                            ingenuity or suggest. Nearly all the bedrooms are provided with
                            balconies and all the larger ones have also fireplaces; and bathrooms,
                            sto., are most conveniently placed. </p>
                        <p>The entire hotel is surrounded by a garder, and mouth of the fruit and
                            vegetables are grown upon the spot, for not only does the manage meat
                            supply its own requirements but also those of the various steamboats
                            which moor ja its vicinity. When all is completed there will be tennis
                            and racquet lawns included: and in time the garden will become another
                            vista of beauty like onto that of the ar jointing Luxor Hotel, which is
                            a riot of gorgeous colouring and sweetly scented ff wers. An annexe is
                            also being built with an engine house to supply the electricity, and
                            bere also will be &amp; model dairy and laundry besides many rooms for
                            the European staff of the botel, private dragomane, aod so forth. </p>
                        <p>The hotel has been completely finished and is ready to receive goeste in
                            every part except the third floor. </p>
                        <p>The arrangements and reservations on the railway journey last night from
                            Cairo were made under the superintendence of Mr. H. W. Tite, the popular
                            representative of the Inter pational Sleeping Car Company in Egypt. Mr.
                            and Mrs. Tito were among the party who arrived here this morning. </p>
                        <p>Mr. Harrison, general manager of Messrs. Thos Cook and Son (Egypt),
                            Limited, and Mr. Mazbach were among the directors of the Upper Egypt
                            Hotels Company who arriv. ed here by this morning's train from Cairo.
                            Mr. George Nangoviob and Mr. Charles Baebler, the other directors, were
                            capable to come. The party from Cairo Numbered twenty five and invaded
                            Judge Rayle • d Mr. N. Spathis. Mr. Flood, the secretary of the company,
                            came down from Cairo to attend the inauguration. I am sorry to say,
                            however, that M. Pagoon, the managing director, will be capable, through
                            indisposition, to attend the inaugural banquet, to which about 150
                            guests have been invited. </p>

                        <p>The following is the "application of complaint" referred to: </p>
                        <p>Sir, - We, the undersigned guards: beg to bring before your notice the
                            following con plaints which we cannot bear any longer. We are formed
                            between two miseries in watching all day and night long, a bard wurk
                            which gives us no results for a little red or even enjoyment on official
                            holidays, andeven w wolk merited sleep during the night off duty; in
                            such a onge it would have been better if we were dead and thats not see
                            others of this world getting their holidays so pleased. After being on
                            daty for a week daring which we soffor the strongest bard-hips, perhaps
                            more this a conviot's, we go home ti-el and wrot hed, ogr eyes closed
                            with the fatigue of our work. We fiad no time to speak to our family but
                            to mqrest them to wake of ap in time to attend to our work thy following
                            porning, the giving us a night hoʻidayahich wa cannot enjoy. Naturally
                            under the hardships wake up not better the presiding nigb, in fear that
                            we may miss the train and got fixed with a fine consisting nearly one
                            day's pay. This is our existence aod that of our family. Moreover the
                            daily living expenses: "uador the high prices of food that Cairo is
                            victimel, are beyond our resob with the poor wager we receive: we ongnot
                            express the life we have to endura, this gives us another point of
                            complaining as we work so maob aad gaia bate so little </p>
                        <p>The ordinary pay of a gaard is £4, 600 mill., if he is not passed andør
                            fizes or he has not to pay the price of some lost articles with the
                            brakeman. Ia this case can this poor sum soffice to the needs of a
                            person who daring a whole month has to pass his nights in different
                            towost Supposing he can pull himself through, what if he has to help his
                            family or his wife and childrenNo answer can ba given to this, but the
                            approval of the hardships we cannot any longer datain. To show you that
                            our expenses are more than what we get, let us ask you the following
                            questions ; Can we find a boose for five persons less than PT. 150
                            monthly 1 Don't we require an ardeb of flur at P.T. 201 Don't we require
                            moreover at least 1516. botter at 120 PT. 1. and some other expenses am
                            dating at least at P.T. 3001 This, then, gives us a very good-ground to
                            complain about our position and wait upon your judgement. </p>

                            grade of men entitled to benefit societies, whereas we pass onr life in

                            victims of some accident. That's our position in the Government service
                            is much inferior to that: of other employés, whose position bas been
                            lately altered. We have no hopes to the pension liat either as we shall
                            never be able to accomplished the quarter of the period of service
                            entitled in these fonoticp: by the continuation of this bard work which
                            les ven us every day in * wretched condition. We hope that you will
                            kindly give us your help in this matter, having aeon our situation in
                            the a few words. This help is eagerly expected and we shall for over and

                        <p>The Green, Acomb, York, Bagland. Dear Sirs :- </p>
                        <p>I thought how moob I should like to write and tell you what great benefit
                            my daughter bas derived from taking your Doan's Backache Kidney Pills.
                            For 8 or 4 years she had been attended by different doctors, and yet bad
                            gradually gone from bad to worse, eventually being confined to her bed
                            for many months. Our own family doctor gave Os so hope whatever-in fact,
                            one day became and told me that she had only a few hours to live. It was
                            droopy, he said, from which abe was suffering. </p>
                        <p>Everyone who saw her felt sure that she couldn't possibly last long. She
                            had to be propped up in bed with a rest, and 9 pillows, to prevent ber
                            from booking. She was so swollen that, when the bed had to be made it
                            took 4 parsons to lift ber ont. The doctor said she must have weighed at
                            least 20 stone. She is only 25 years of age. </p>
                        <p>In one day, the doctor tapped 16 pints of water from her log. </p>
                        <p>Last December a friend of ours came to see DF, and she told us of an
                            aposentados who bad derived maoh benefit from Doao's Backsobe Kidney
                            Pills. We therefore thought we would try the pills, and when my daughter
                            bad finished the second box she said that abe felt a little easier. Ever
                            since that time she has gradually improved. </p>
                        <p>She has finished her 17th box this week, and is actually able to get out
                            of bed and dress herself, and even walk about the village, epaided.
                            Those who saw her in bed are astonished at finding her able to get about
                            again, and they may it is almost a miracle. I tell them it is Dan's
                            Baokaobe K dney Pills that have saved my daughter's life. I shall never
                            cease to recommend this splendid medicine. </p>
                        <p>My daughter was in bed altogether for 11 weeks, never leaving the bed
                            except when she was lifted ont to have it made. She has now been
                            downstairs 3 weeks. </p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. War, - Your delightful and most interesting book on the SOudan has
                        reached me. I congraulate you heartily on the excellent manner in which the
                        work is written and illustrated. All of us who have done our little best to
                        regenerate the country, after its terrible misfortunes, have received more
                        than kind treatment at your hands...I don't suppose anyone realises more
                        than I do the change that has come over the Sudan since my old and
                        tyrannical master the Phalifa disappeared from the scene. Your description
                        of the Peace and Progress, is in fact, a sequal to my Fire and Sqord in the
                        Sudan.</p>
                    <p>With kindest regards, believe me,</p>
                    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
