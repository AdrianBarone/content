                            APRIL 5, 1907 ENGLAND OF TO - DAY. Up to Waterloo we had a definite aim,
                            the upholding of national power. This we did by means of the navigation
                            laws, tariffs, and the mercantile system generally. But with the removal
                            of our rivals we threw aside all trade weapons, assuming that our
                            supremacy was a permanent international condition. The intimate
                            connection between the economic life of the country and its capacity for
                            defence was utterly forgotten, and wealth pursued, oblivious of the fact
                            that it was gained at the cost of strength. As a member of the House
                            said recently, English power rests on a pillar whose base is abroad. She
                            perceives that competitors have arisen as formidable as any with which
                            she has had to contend, but she does not perceive that she is not in the
                            same relative position towards them as she was in the seventeenth and
                            eighteenth centuries. Then her numerical inferiority did not count,
                            since she was so far head of every other nation that her commercial,
                            financial, and maritime preponderance have her the necessary staying
                            power But now that Germany and the United States are adding to their
                            numbers at a rate which leaves us far behind, and developing in a way
                            that already they see themselves sitting in our place, </p>

                            <p>the matter of population is becoming a de. termining factor in our destiny. Again, during the Napoleonic wars we were self-supporting. By 1856 we could grow food enough for only 24,000,000. To-day we can feed less than | 4,000,000 In short, the physical foundation of our strength and the only industry essential
                                to a country are being sacrificed to an academie | theory, which divorces economics from politics,
                                But this is not all. Our whole conception of our relations with our neighbours rests on a fallacy, the absolute and relative predominance of England. Our industries and commercial methods, banking and credit system, diplomacy and fiscal policy, naval and military disposi. tions, were all organised in the heyday of our greatness, and next to nothing has been done to adapt them to modern conditions. Of late it has begun to dawn on us that we have keen competitors where we once had none, and that a tremendous international conflict is possible. | But we comfort ourselves with the thought that we shall rise to the occasion as we did in times past, forgetting that we have thrown aside the means with contempt. The very forces which are bound to bring on the crisis of the future will make money-making impossible and destroy our credit. In the eighteenth century the world was compelled to take onr goods because we held what was practically a monopoly of manufacturing power. Therefore a rise in prices, though it entailed suffering, did not disturb the labour market. With foreign * activity and our own passivity the unemployed has become such an insoluble problem in peace time that Ministers fear to put an infinitesimal tax on food for great national and Imperial ends. What would happen in war time? Oar naval supremacy depends on our preeminence in engineering, electrical and allied industries. At the present moment it may be doubted whether we could carry out a naval programme if we were cut off from foreign sources of supply. This is a question which should be raised in Parliament, since it marks the artificial and mechanical conditions brought about by following the lead of nature in a realm where the mind should be king. It is no new thing in history. Every great commercial Empire of which we have record arrived at the same stage of defenceless opu| lence at which England is gradually arriving. But she alone of them has built up daughter States United by bands of sentiment and interest to herself, and therein lies her salva-tion. As a nation she cannot hope to keep her place among the mighty Empires which are growing up on every side of her. But as the head of a federation of free peuples she has a future before her larger than any of them. Being in a manner detached, Colonials see the position more clearly than Englishmen, and are better able to take measures for its relief. But they have gone as far as they can without the cooperation of the Mother Country. She, for her part, is learning in the school of experience. It is not so long ago since she laughed at Mr. Seddon for saying that some of the excess of our imports over exports were I paid for in coin But the latest German Green Book proves that his sturdy common-sonne had hit the mark During the past ten years there has been a drain of gold from this country to Germany of £63,000,000—enough to pay for her navy twice over, 'And then we wonder that the Colonies will not make cash contributions to the British Navy. Unless we recognise that financial predominance is bound to follow in manufacturing supremacy, and devise a system to meet the need on an Imperial instead of a national basis, we must pass as other | Empires have passed. To rely on sentiment Talone is to rely on a liminishing quantity, as each part of Greater Britain perceives that its first duty is to itself. Moreover, neither the Boers nor the French-Canadians can be expected to understand loyalty as Britons understand it, and neither can the stream of emigrants from the United States and Europe, which is filling up the Dominion's waste spaces. Sentiment will always be a factor overseas, but it will gradually become less able to bear a strain. We are told that commercial bonds aro "squalid, ” and would only lead to friction. As this is the plea of politicians who sacrifice Imperial interests wholesale to base party ends, it is not worth much. If sentiment.could stand half a century of Manchesterism, which violated every principle of Colonial growth it can stand a commercial system of which the Colonies themselves will be one of the main pillars. “Defensive league' without a trade league is the veriost dream.

                        LONDON, Friday.

They believe that such a system would give a real and reliable military organisation, instead of what, with all respect to Mr Hallane's honesty and ability, is at best but a make-believe.

                        EGYPTIAN COTTON MILLS LIMITED.
                        THE COMPANY'S FUTURE.
                        It will be remembered that an informal meeting of the shareholders of the Egyptian Cotton Mills was held on the 6th of February at the Anglo-Egyptian Bank, when Baron Selig de Kusel Bey read a proposal for the reconstruction of this Company, but it was pointed out by a shareholder that it was useless to attempt a reconstruction so long as the Government levied an excise duty of 8%, and and it was unanimously decided to request the Board of Directors to approach the Govern. ment with a view to get this tax abolished.
                        The Ministry of Finance has now communicated the decision of the Government not to raise the tax. This must be a disappointment to many shareholders, but on the other hand it would be right to infer that, in the course of two months, the Government has given the matter its full consideration, and it has even been said that Lord Cromer visited the mills at Boulac.
                        As a matter of fact it would appear to be conclusive that had the Government been able to save this industry by simply raising the excise duty, or even suspending it for a few years, it would have done so. It also becomes the more remarkable that these cotton mills established in 1899 in a cotton growing country, and placed under a skilled English manager, have never paid å dividend, nor have they ever been able to compete against the Lancashire mills.
                        An extraordinary meeting of the shareholders of the Company will be convened shortly.
                        The best course for the Company to take at this juncture is to decide on a voluntary liquidation. The land belonging to the Company has increased greatly in value and if it were disposed of the shareholders should receive a fair return. The company's property at Boulac consists of thirteen thousand square metres. The landlord of the property immediately adjoining is said to have refused an offer of PT. 750 per square metre...

                        The company has entered into an agreement with the Egyptian Lands and Agenoy Limited, to acquire the benefit of an option to purchase the valuable estate belonging to Mr N Gianaclis, comprising approximately 4,440 1 feddans, situated in Abou-el-Matamir and Neguilah (Province of Behera), near Alexandria, at the price of £32 sterling per feddan, or a total of about £142,000 sterling, Toile Bey, the well-known land expert, of Alexandria, has inspected and reported upon this property.

                        <head>SITUATION FURTHER COMPLICATED</head>
                        <p> (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)
                            Port Said, Thursday. The strike which was started last Friday by the coal-discharging arabs, and joined by the bunkering men on Tuesday, spread yesterday to the labourers of the Suez Canal Co, who left work without notice. The strike may prove very serious before long, there being talk of the boatmen joining the strikers.
                            Yesterday everything passed off quietly with the exception of a few scufiles in the Arab village. This morning, however, the mounted police were again called out to maintain order on the quay, where a large crowd of Arabs were collecting with the intention of stopping others from coaling the SS Ormuz of the Orient Mail Line, which arrived at
                            9 a.m, bound from London to Australia with my passengers. The agents of the Ormuz had engaged about 30 Arabs, mostly boys, and with the help of the ship's cranes were able to supply her with a fair amount of bunker coal in bags. The Ormuz was still coaling at 5 p.m.
                            The masters held a lengthy conference yesterday, meeting at an early hour, and at noon adjourned for lunch and at the conclusion of the meeting at 5 p.m, the general impression was that with the influence of the Governor who
                            has displayed great energy, willingness and tact in dealing with the matter, an amicable arrangement might soon be come to.
                            There is no doubt that the strike is in no way caused by the masters under paying their sheikhs ; during the last few days the question has been subjected to close inquiry and on the basis of the payments made during the last six months it appears that the men can easily earn four francs per day and leave a fair surplus for the sheikh himself. Under the circumstances the general opinion is that there is no reason whatsoever for the masters to advance their tariff.
                            Those who are at all acquainted with the coaling trade will understand that 99 % of the deliveries are made under contract with the owners of the steamship companies. These contracts generally extend over a period of twelve months from January to the following December. It is therefore only natural that the masters will resist to their utmost any advance in the cost of labour, as should they give way and meet the demands made by the strikers, they would be suffering the additional expenses for the next eight months, which would mean a dead loss by their contracts for 1907.
                            After careful inquiries on all hands I have come to the opinion that the sheikhs them. selves are the source of the whole trouble, and in the early stages of the strike when scratch labour was obtainable, some of the, sheikhs fearing that the work would proceed with only slight inconvenience, attempted to influence their gangs to return, but by their refusal to do so, one is justified in believing that these men were influenced by those who employed them (the sheikhs), to come out on strike for more money
                            Thursday Later. Owing to the trouble this morning the police authorities have thought it advisable to strengthen their force and by a draft of mounted police from Cairo, and I understand these were wired for this morning. se
                            Another long meeting of masters was held this afternoon, owing, it is reported, to the men refusing to consider the masters proposals, and I have it froin good authority that the problem is no nearer being settled than it was last Saturday, is no nearer being settled than it was last Saturday.

                        <p>THE DENISHWAI AFFAIR.
                            In commenting upon the Denshawai affair in his report for 1906 Lord Cromer writes :
                            I do not propose to dwell at any length on what is known as the "Deusho wai affair.” All I have to say on this subject was stated in a Memorandum, dated the 12th July, 1906, which has already been published. I have only to add that no one can re.ret more than myself, or, I am convinced, more than the various local authorities who were called upon to take action, the occurrence of this most untoward incident
                            In two respects, its results were certainly very unfortunate.
                            In the first place, although I have never entertained the least doubt as regards both the necessity of taking prompt and effective measures to punish the attack on the British officers, or the justice of the decisions at which the Court appointed to try the prisoners Arrived, I do not conceal from myself that the episode was calculated to leave on the minds of those who are imperfectly acquainted with Egyptian affairs a wholly erroneous impression of the spirit in which the government and administration of the country is being conducted This, of itself, is very much to je regretted.
                            In the second place, inasmuch as the Denhawai affair occurred before the excitement caused by the Turco-Egyptian frontier dispute iad subsided, it was not unnaturally supposed that there was some connection between the two incidents. In reality, Lot only were they wholly unconnected, but they were not contemporaneous. The frontier dispute was virtually settled on the 15th May, on which day Sir Nicholas 'Conor addressed a final note to the Turkish minister for Foreign Affairs. The Denshawai fray did not occur till the 13th June.
                            The only extraneous subject with which the Denshawai affair was in any way connected ras that on which I dwelt in my Memorandum of the 12th July, and to which I have, of ite years, frequently drawn attention It pastitated one amongst many instances showing a growing spirit of lawlessness, due, for he most part, not to political causes, but to the great difficulty of preserving law and order in egypt during the period of transition from arbitrary to legal forms of government, through which the country has for some years been assigned.
                            I have only to add that the question of how, or the future, offences against members of the army of Occupation should be treated is still the 2nd January) under consideration. It is He which, both from the technically legal, and we practical point of view presents considerable difficulties. In a footnote Lord Cromer remarks :As it has on several occasions been insinua
                            that the publication of an anonymous letter--which was attached to a despatch I wrote about the frontier dispute and which attracted much attention was in some degree up to a desire to justify the severity of the anishments awarded by the Special Tribunal
                            the Denshawai prisoners. I take this opportunity of stating that my dispatch. is ited the 21st May-that is to say, nearly a month before the Denshawai incident occurred. d. The misapprehension may have been due
                            the fact that the dispatch was not laid before Parliament until July. The delay in the application was, I believe, due to the time quired to prepare a map, or to some such urely non-political cause.

                            ZIZINIA THEATRE.
                            The exploitation of a distorted brain as a form of dramatic art is one which admits of boundless possibilities and, once having started, the difficulty is not how to continue but where to leave off. Less skilful author-dram. artists than Erkmann and Chatrian would have yielded to the temptation of straining the grotesque element and, in the case of a play such as "Le Juif Polonais”, the personal signification may too easily be sporificed to an överdone pantomime bogey effect. And this temptation lies no less with the dramatist than with the actor. M. de Féraudy, however, in a remarkably convincing performance on Wed. newsday evening, struck exactly the right nota in clothing his "Mathis" with as much power and as little rant as the part permitted. In the first two acts he never fails to convey the impression that Mathis acts, not to the andience, but to his little family circle, and hence the mortal necessity of keeping up the deception before them, whilst a mere hint now and then of the mental torture he is undergoing is gufficient to let his audience into the secret. Unlike some other impersonators of the part, M, de Féraudy pays a compliment to our understanding in allowing us to imagine the sound of the accusatory bells instead of having them actually jingled behind the scenes. As for the third act, it requires a gifted actor of M. de Féraudy's calibre to do justice to its complications : he must dream, then speak when he is dreaming, then dream when he is speaking, then again speak when he is dreaming, then reverse the entire order until he is is awakened but still imagines himself dream.is awakened but still imagines himself dreaming. M. de Féraudy's rendering of this "wheels within wheels” effect was of zootropic excellence; he snores to perfection, he storms and howls before the judges, is sullenly obedient to the hypnotist, quails miserably, under the death sentence and expires with a tragic suddenness. A character study of this nature. requires and gets but little assistance; however, in their small way, M.M Sévérin and Gournac and Mmes Hélène Marie and Marie-Laure (particularly the latter) acquitted themselves well, as did the remainder of the cast, for which space forbids mention,
                            "L'Age Difficile," given last night, is one of the most delightful pieces the Zizinia has seen for some time. The principal charm of M. Lemaitre's comedy lies in the witty, almost irresponsibly witty, dialogue, which constantly reminded uy of Mr. Barrie's style and occasionally of Oscar Wilde's. The plot, in itself a trifle unwieldy, seems rather to support the dialogue than the reverse, and the piece, just as with Wilde's and, in a less degree, Barrie's plays, would fall altogether flat, were it not in the bands of spirited and talented artists, With Me Féraudy at the helm, success" was assured and it is hard to find praise enough for the delicacy, the breadth, the humour and above all the naturalness of his performance, His powerful monologue in Act II is surpassed only by his delightfully witty and satirical handling of the greater part of Act. III, and the joy of it all is that there is no touch of staginess, no attempt and no necessity to seek in Artificial effects, nothing in fact to deber the reiteration that M de Féraudy is one of the greatest actors of the day, Very able support was rendered by Mlle Heléne Maia, who gave a sympathetic and artfully artless portrayal.1 of Jeanne Martigny, also by Mile Bressant, whose acting was no less charming than her appearance, and by the usual finished acting of Mme Marie-Laure. M. Bauer, as the Comte de Vaneuse, had all the staginess of which M. de Féraudy is so happily accepted, and if he left no very good impression, it was at any rate an impression. M. Sévérin, the jeune premier, always works hard and as Pierre Martigny, gave a good account of himself in a default part,
