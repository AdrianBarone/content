                        it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or the

                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot climates

                    but shows no falling-off in the vigilance or
                    comprehensive energy of the body of experts
                    who have been entrusted since 1881 with the
                    difficult and delicate task of protecting the
                    Mohammedan monuments, alike from the

                General State of the Cairo monuments
                now leaves little to be desired in point of preservation, 
                so far as the preservation of such peculiar Parish of old 
                buildings as possible, and the chief 
                interest of the present report lies in
                its record of restoration. 
                We are always anxious when we 
                read of restoration but we are bound to say that the 
                indefatigable Chief Architect of the Cairo 
                Commission, Herz Bey, whose hand and brain 
                are prominent and every page of the report do as much 
                to allay our fears. In his earliest attempts
                he was perhaps inclined to be rash, and the 
                results were sometimes crude; but he has learned much 
                by long experience and patient study and will naturally
                eager, as a true architect to carry into perfect 
                realization his ideas of what Saracenic art really 
                was in its integrity, he is scrupulous and adhering 
                strictly and faithfully to the minutest details 
                of the original designs. We know it was satisfaction 
                that the condition upon which doctor Stanley Lane 
                Poole especially insisted in his report to Lord Cromer 
                on the preservation of the monument 10 years 
                ago - namely, that every scrap of new work added to 
                an historical monument must be authenticated by an 
                inscription given the date of such addition- has been 
                carefully observed. This is not only essential 
                in the interest of historical honesty, but as her 
                they observes, is also in keeping with the custom of 
                the Mamluk restorers themselves though their motive
                was rather self-glorification than scientific 
                authentication of the data of architectural history. 
                The chief work of restoration at present in hand is 
                that of the famous mosque of Sultan Hassan, 
                on which Herz Bey has published an elaborate monograph. 
                The details of this comprehensive restoration
                seem to have excited some criticism, especially on 
                the part of that very competent authority Artin Pasha;
                But we must wait for fuller reports before dealing with 
                this question. So far as we have ourselves 
                observed his work, Herz Bey There is no pains to get it
                the exact original materials, designs, and 
                colors, before introducing any modern reproductions; 
                but it is manifestly impossible to reproduce 
                the softones of age in New work. The principal
                Restoration lately completed is that of the fine 
                colonnaded Mosque of el-Maridani, a famous Mamluk
                emir of the fourteenth century, who was Saqi, 
                or cupbearer to the Sultan-en-Nasir b. Qalaun,
                to whose reign many of the finest Saracenic monuments
                belong. Those who saw this great ruin in the 
                90s probably regarded it as a hopeless Wreck. 
                The Columns and roofs were short up with endless
                scaffold poles; stucco work was crumbling on the 
                ground, the inlaid mosaics were almost indistinguishable;
                and the whole was a mass of dirt and dust.
                Yet for those who understood there was enough
                of the original work left to make restoration 
                of bare possibility, and such treatment of a large 
                Mosque of the congregational colonnaded type was 
                eminently Desirable in order to 
                show this type in its Perfection. 
                Heather to most of the Restorations 
                at Cairo had been restricted to 
                the smaller to most of the transept and 
                other types. The work upon L maradani
                was begun in 1897, and 
                the mosque was at last we open for public prayer
                and April, 1905. It was certainly a Triumph of 
                architectural scale. Walls, columns, roofs, 
                utterly decayed and tottering, had to be taken down;
                but all the columns  and stones that could be used again 
                were numbered and correspondence with the detailed 
                plan of the mosque, and set up again and their own place.
                Traces of conical green tile work were found 
                on some of the crenellations - reminding one of the 
                mosque of el-Nasir in the Citadel- this fact was not 
                lost sight of in the restoration. Without any attempt 
                to restore the whole building to its original state 
                of decoration, which would have been a costly process, 
                and might have a vote criticism on the score of 
                gaudiness, the plan was adopted of restoring completely
                samples of each class, e.g.  the painted ceilings
                , the Gilded Corinthian capitals, are represented by only
                a few specimens in the original colors, so far 
                as they can be reproduced. the main object was the preservation
                of the building and its entirety not the
                reproduction of all the decorative details and the distinction
                was wise. The mosaics in the Mihrab, or 
                prayer-niche, however, have been fully reproduced. Some of the 
                original carved panels of the pulpit 
                where fortunately recovered from Europe, but no attempt was made
                to supply the place of the missing 
                panels by modern carving. The Dome over the niche presented a
                difficulty, since it had disappeared 
                for centuries;  but a new dawn was finally constructed. 
                The ablution tank was brought from the mosque of 
                Sultan Hassan-  a step which has provoked critical comment, 
                but which was perhaps justifiable, since it 
                did not belong to the original constructions of that mosque.

                in the present report to an account of the history of el-Maridani’s  
                foundation and its restoration, and

                his remarks by 7:30 graphs representing
                the Moss before and after restoration. We are very glad to notice that,
                following the recommendations already
                referred to in Lord Cromer's report, no restorations are be gone until 
                complete plan and photographs have been made of each monument in its untouched
                state. The commission is to be warmly congratulated on its scrupulous
                care of the beautiful monuments placed under its charge. </p> </div>

                                                    Cromer’s work, the “Spectator” says :—
                                                    
                                                    “We note with great satisfaction that a
                                                    moyement is on foot to bestow some special
                                                    mark of the national gratitude on Lord Cromer
                                                    and that it is suggested that this should take
                                                    the form of a money grant. We very much hope
                                                    that the Government will propose such a
                                                    grant_to the House of Commons, and that
                                                    Lord Cromer will not veto the scheme. It is
                                                    no secret that Lord Cromer is anything but a
                                                    rich man, and, though he never encouraged
                                                    undue lavishness or extravagance in the style
                                                    of living adopted ‘at the British Agency, his
                                                    official salary only just enabled him to keep.up
                                                    the large establishment required by his official
                                                    position, and to meet the great calls made
                                                    upon the purse.of one who was not only the
                                                    actual ruler‘of Egypt, but also the head of the

                                                    haye felt.for many years that his salary ought
                                                    at least to have been as large as that of the
                                                    Governor of Madras (£8,000) or the. -Ambas-
                                                    sador in Paris (£10,000). . Yet, as a matter of
                                                    fact, it was only £6,500, and this though
                                                    Cairo is an exceedingly expensive place in

                                                    made it impossible to suggest an increase of

                                                    the whole matter should, on a new eppaint-

              LORD CROMER'S LIFE WORK.
            
           
            
            A NATION'S GRATITUDE.
            
            Commenting upon the movement to mark 
            the gratitude of Great Britain for Lord
            Cromer’s work, the “Spectator” says :—
            
            “We note with great satisfaction that a
            moyement is afoot to bestow some special
            mark of the national gratitude on Lord Cromer
            and that it is suggested that this should take
            the form of a money grant. We very much hope
            that the Government will propose such a
            grant to the House of Commons, and that
            Lord Cromer will not veto the scheme. It is
            no secret that Lord Cromer is anything but a
            rich man, and, though he never encouraged
            undue lavishness or extravagance in the style
            of living adopted at the British Agency, his
            official salary only just enabled him to keep up
            the large establishment required by his official
            position, and to meet the great calls made
            upon the purse of one who was not only the
            actual ruler of Egypt, but also the head of the
            British coleny in Cairo. Lord Cromer’s friends
            have felt for many years that his salary ought
            at least to have been as large as that of the
            Governor of Madras (£8,000) or the Ambas-
            sador in Paris (£10,000). . Yet, as a matter of
            fact, it was only £6,500, and this though
            Cairo is an exceedingly expensive place in
            which to live according to the European stan-
            dard. Lord Cromer’s feelings in the matter
            made it impossible to suggest an increase of
            pay for the British Agent during his tenure of
            the office, but we think if is only right that
            the whole matter should, on a new appoint-
            ment, be carefully reconsidered.”

            THEATRE ZIZINIA.
            
            On Saturday: evening Monsieur Stephanos
            Christaki, the teacher of eloention and drama-
            tic recitation, took part ‘in a gala performance
            organised by his namerous pupils, on the occa-
            sion of his impending departure. For the first
            and most important part of the programme,
            Jean Richepin’s “Je Flibustier” was chosen and
            proved a very acceptable item. ‘The fine verses
            of the well known French playright were very
            intelligently given ont by Mr. Christaki in the
            title role of Francois Legoés, and although
            oceasionally his intonation was slighty irregu-
            lar,- his words were always clear. His perform-
            ance right through was very creditable and
            his @fforts fully deserved the applause which
            aredted him at the end of the second‘act. The
            other characters were satisfactorily handled by
            M.M. Hornbostel, Mors, Nicolas and Kremer
            land Mmes. Nicolas and Beraldi ; all proved
            themselves conscientious pupils and if, at
            times, their delivery . was a little amateurish,
            their elocution was always correct and distinct.
            The evening closed with “15 Heures de Fiacre!”
            a two act comedy by Clairville and Nuitter
            aid in this, Mr Christaki brought peals of
            langhter from his andience. Although the
            piece in itself does not call for any special
            remark, the artists of the evening to whom
            were added M.M. Paal, Levy, Piron, Autofage
            and Blanc, did their-very best and succeeded

                    GREEK SCHOOL AT CHATBY.
                    
                    FOUNDED BY MR. G. ZERVUDACHI.
                    Yesterday afternoon at five o'clock the
                    foundation stone of the preparatory school for
                    Greek children, to be built by the generosity
                    of Mr. George Zervudachi, was laid in the
                    presence of a large gathering of the members of
                    the Alexandrian Greek community. Nearly
                    five thousand persons were present at the
                    ceremony which was most brilliant and impos-
                    ing ; among them we noticed Hafiz Bey, Sub-
                    Governor of Alexandria, Mr Gould, H.B.M’s,
                    Consul, Mr. Scotidis, Hellenta, Consol Gamanal,
                    Dr, Schiess Pasha, Mr. Chataway, Mr and
                    Mrs. Emmanuel, Benachi, Mr. Michel Sinadino,
                     Mr. D. Tambacopoulg, Mr. and Mrs. George
                    Zervudachi and family, Mr. Sivitanidis, Mr.
                    Karam, Mr. Paleologo Giorgiou, headmaster
                    of the Alexandria Greek boys schools with the
                    teaching staff and the higher class pupils, Mrs
                    Stampa, head mistress of the girls schools
                    with teaching staff and pupils.
                    
                    The religious ceremony was conducted by
                    his Beatitude, Mgr. Photios, Patriarch of the
                    Greek Orthodox Church, who was accom-
                    panied by the Bishop of Tripoli, Mgr. Teofanis
                    Mosconas, and the clergy of the Greek
                    Churches. After the ceremony was concluded
                    and the blessing had been delivered, the
                    otticial document was signed by the authorities
                    and the leading members of the colony, and
                    the stone was laid by Mr. George Zervudachi
                    assisted by Master Constantine and Miss Kitty
                    Zervudachi and the elder pupils of the gymna-
                    sium. Several speeches were delivered, the first
                    speaker being Mr. Benachi, president of the
                    community, who thanked Mr. Zervadachi in
                    their name. Mr. Zervudachi in reply expressed
                    his desire to do his utmost to further the
                    education of his compatriots and instill in
                    them the principles of humanity. Speeches
                    were also given by Mr. Scotidis and Mgr.
                    Photios and at half past five the assembly
                    broke up. During the ceremony the music was
                    supplied by the boys school band and the
                    Greek philharmonic band.

                        Larnaca, April 19.
                        The election petition proceedings are
                        approaching the end and it is expected that
                        judgment will be given case within the
                        next few days. Meanwhile the Legislative
                        Council has been getting through its pro-
                        gramme and during the past week has been
                        concerned witha private Bill relating to the
                        election of an Archbishop, which is, here,an
                        ever-burning question. The Bill, we under-
                        tand, has now reached the Committee stage ;
                        how much further it will go remains to be seen.
                        
                        Artesian Wells.
                        
                        The Artesian well-boring operations, which
                        were commenced near the chief secretariat
                        buildings some two years or more ago have
                        now ceased, and the plant has lately been
                        removed to another spot. The boring which
                        had been carried to a depth of about 800 feet
                        had to be abandoned owing to the rocky
                        nature of the soil which was met with, render-
                        ing further operations impracticable. It is to
                        be hoped that better results will be attained
                        from the new borings now to be commenced,
                        as success in obtaining water by this means
                        should prove a turning point in the general
                        agriculture of the country.
                        
                       For the S.P.C.A.
                        
                        On the 11th instant a fancy dress ball was
                        given in the theatre, Nicosia, in aid of the
                        branch of the 8.P.C.A. Owing to the date
                        ing during the Greek Lent very few of the
                        Greek conmmunity were present, which, from
                        the Society’s point of view, must have been
                        regrettable and must have caused a diminution
                        in the anticipated receipts. The evening,
                        however, passed off very well and the dresses
                        were gay and for the most part picturesque
                        and effective. The gentlemen’s prize went to a
                        "Golliwog,” while the ladies prize was politely
                        awarded to the honorary secretary of the soci-
                        ety. Other dresses worthy of notice were: Be-
                        rengaria, two ladies of the Court of Louis XIV.,
                        Queen Elizabeth, a Norwegian peasant, and an
                        early Victorian young lady ; while among the
                        gentlemen’s were Richard, Coeur de Lion, a
                        North American Indian, Sir Walter Raleigh,
                        Black and White, and the Education Bill. The
                        theatre had been tastefully decorated for the
                        occasion, and an excellent effect was produced
                        by shading the strong central Lux light with
                        coloured gauze, lengths of which were made to
                        radiate from it and carried to the various
                        boxes of the first tier. The Zaptieh band pro-
                        vided the music.
                        
                        Amateur Dramatic Society.
                        
                        An Amateur Dramatic Society has just
                        been formed among the English com-
                        munity, with its headquarters in Nicosia.
                        Its first private performance was held on
                        the 9th instant at the house of Lt Col.
                        and Mrs. Gore, kindly lent by them for
                        the occasion. The programme was varied and
                        consisted of singing, tableaux, incidental music
                        and two diologues; The net proceeds go to a
                        charity fund, specially formed by the society,
                        Admission was by invitation only, but we hear
                        that the entertainment was mich appreciated
                        by those who were present. The society should
                        be a welcome addition to the English social
                        life at the metropolis, and prove the means
                        of developing and displaying a fair amount
                        of local talent.
                        
                        Cricket Match.
                        
                        On Saturday the 12th instant a cricket match
                        was played at Nicosia, Nicosia C.Club v. The
                        Island. Although the latter included some very
                        fair players and were regarded as a strong
                        eleven they suffered a disastrous defeat, for
                        the home team declared their innings at 293
                        for eight wickets and succeeded in despatching
                        their opponents for the Gi gl of
                        27. The latter then followed on, with scarcely
                        better results and were all out in their second-
                        innings for 57. A return match will doubtless
                        be arranged when we hope to witness a change
                        of fortune.
                        
                        Feeding of Animals.
                        
                        This spring has been one of plenty in the
                        matter of green fodder, and cattle of all kinds
                        have been able to get more than their usual
                        allowance of succulent food. Owing to many
                        rainy days, the green barley has not
                        matured as rapidly as is generally the case
                        and the animals have therefore enjoyed a longer
                        spell in the fields than falls to their lot in
                        average years. There has been a great shortage
                        of Horses for the public conveyances and a
                        considerable advance upon the ordinary fee
                        has had to be paid.
                        
                        Tourists.
                        The Limassol Steamship Company has
                        brought, within the last week or two, several
                        to the Island, either for business or
                        pleasure. Had the weather been more favour-
                        able over here a few weeks ago a still larger
                        influx of tourists from Egypt would probably
                        have taken place.

                        interesting relics of the later stages of the
                        Soudan Campaign, in which her husband, the
                        late Sir William Gatacre, K.C.B., was in com-
                        mand of the British division during the
                        advance on Khartoum and Omdarman. They
                        include the black flag belonging to the Khalfa,
                        and also the head dress worn by the Dervish
                        leader at the time of his final overthrow.

                        MEmORIAL TABLET.
                        
                        A few friends of the late Colonel Frank Rho-
                        des, C.B,D.S.0., of the 1st. Royal Dragoons,
                        have recently placed on thenorth wall ofDalham
                        Church, near Newmarket, a memorial tablet
                        to this gallant officer, whose distinguished
                        career was cut short by death at the Appa in
                        September, 1905.
                        The tablet records the many campaigns in
                        the Sudan and Africa, in which the deceased
                        took part, including the actions of El Teb,
                        Tamai, Abu-klea, Tamai, the Atbara, and
                        Omdurman, where he was severely wounded.
                        It also mentions that he acted as Chief of
                        Staff to General Sir Gerald Portal on his
                        his mission to Uganda, and took part in the

                        A most interesting lecture illustrated by
                        lantern slides is to be given at Port-Said en
                        Wednesday at the Eldorado theatre by Capt
                        Armitage on “The Antartic Regions.” Capt.
                        Armitage (Lieut. R. N; R.) was one of the
                        commanders of the Discovery in the expedi-
                        tion to the South Pole and also on the
                        Windward in her voyage towards the North

                        The proceeds are in aid of the lady Strang-
                        ford Hospital, and it is to be hoped for-the
                        benefit of the hospital, which has proved itself
                        invaluable to the port, that the lecture will be
                        well patronized. The upkeep of -such an
                        institution is naturally very costly and the
                        income is not by any means too large The
                        chair will be taken by — Langiord Clarke.
