                            prices. The chief cause of the decline has been the unsettled state of

                            reports, principally from Texas, where the drought had caused so much

                            application being on the ground of insufficient time to obtain legal

                    <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                    <p> Dear Sir,—I wonder how many sports men witnessed the racing between the four
                        Rowing Clubs of Alexandria yesterday in the harbour without being amused at
                        the farce the same represented. Of the four races two were “row-overs”; and
                        in the other two fouls occurred and nobody knew who was the winner. There
                        was apparent ly no umpire but a sort of Committee launch which also acted as
                        starter. At the end of each race this launch was besieged by some of the
                        competitors and their compatriots, and it appeared to an onlooker that the
                        one who shouted the loudest won the race. This was particularly the case
                        after the sculling race when one gentleman went along side the launch in a
                        boat specially to fight the cause of his man. Why was there no independent
                        umpire who should have been in a launch of this own and whose decision
                        should be absolutely final? Apparently these things are not understood here
                        like they are in Europe. <lb/>Yours truly, <lb/>Britisher. <lb/>Alexandria,
                        August 26.</p>

                        <p>We have received, with the rest of the press, a copy of the programme of
                            the self dubbed “Egyptian National Party” issued by the “Egyptian
                            Committee,” whatever that may mean—under cover of a letter from Hafiz
                            Awad, of the “Al Minbar.” This gentle man, as will be remembered, was
                            Mr. Ro bertson’s guide, philosopher and friend, dur ing the cursory
                            visit which he paid to this country during last winter, and it may be
                            presumed that in return for services render ed Mr. Robertson has lent a
                            helping hand in compiling his new Egyptian Constitution. It is accepted
                            on all hands that it requir es many years of careful and patient study
                            before one can be in a position to put one self forward as an authority
                            on such mo mentous questions, and one has only to read the proposals to
                            at once realize that its authors have neither the requisite know ledge
                            to deal with such complex problems, nor can one believe they have
                            Egypt’s real welfare at heart. The following are the com munications
                            addressed to Sir Edward Grey:—</p>

                        <p>To the<lb/>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. <lb/>Sir,<lb/>I have
                            the honour to submit to you the en closed outline of the views and
                            wishes of the Egyptian nation as regards the changes in the
                            Administration of Egypt which we have reason to believe will be
                            satisfactory to our people, having been already sanctioned by the
                            General Assembly at its recent meeting, and which appear to us to be of
                            a nature which His Majesty’s Government may properly agree to. <lb/>The
                            proposals for establishing the Constitu tion which I have the honour to
                            submit, are based on the schemes put forward by the Earl of Dufferin in
                            1883. These proposals are capable of expansion or modification as may be
                            deemed expedient when the details are ar ranged; but we venture to think
                            that they are the minimum of the reforms necessary for the reasonable
                            satisfaction of the Egyptian people, in accordance with the pledges
                            repeatedly given to them by the Representatives of His Majesty’s
                            Government. <lb/>I may add that copies of this letter and the enclosure
                            will be torwarded to Members of Parliament and the Press.<lb/>I have the

                        <p>1. Electoral Law, 1883. — The only amend ment proposed is to substitute
                            Direct for Indirect representation. In other words to abolish the
                            “electeur délégué,” and let the people vote directly for the Members who
                            are to represent them in both Chambers.</p>
                        <p>2. Organic Law, 1883. — Retain two Cham- bers as at present. Let the
                            Legislative Conncil be the Lower or First Chamber and the General
                            Assembly the Second Chamber. Retain the same number of Members in the
                            First Chamber, but sub stitute seven Under Secretaries of State— one for
                            each Ministry—for seven of the nominated members. Second Chamber to be
                            costituted as at present, save that the Members of the First Chamber are
                            to be excluded therefrom, except when deli berating upon the Budget
                            proposals. An nual Sessions of sufficient length to permit of proper
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>3. Qualification of Members of both Cham bers to be identical, viz., L.E.
                            20 paid in taxation on property per annum. This would necessitate the
                            lowering of the property qualification for the First Chamber.</p>
                        <p>4. Sittings of both Chambers to be free to the Public and Press.</p>
                        <p>5. Rules or Procedure to be passed by a Joint Committee of both

                            Chamber to which they belong.</p>
                        <p>7. No law from and after the promulgation of this decree to be valid
                            unless it has been voted by both Cham bers and received the assent of
                            His Highness the Khedive.</p>
                        <p>8. The veto of His Highness the Khedive may be overridden by a vote of
                            two-thirds majority of both Chambers.</p>
                        <p>9. Accounts for preceding year and Budget to be presented to both
                            Chambers on 1st March and to be dealt with by 31st March.</p>
                        <p>10. President and two Vice-Presidents for each Chamber to be elected by
                            the Cham bers themselves.</p>
                        <p>11. Powers of Chambers. Full jurisdiction in all matters which are purely

                            of the Legislative Council and General Assem bly, but any limitations
                            necessary to secure Foreign Powers and Foreigners from legislative
                            interference to be ac cepted.</p>

                    <p>From a racing point of view there was no cause for grumbling at Saturday's
                        August Skye Meeting, but it is a pity these enjoyable “off season"
                        gatherings are not more numerously attended. It gives the organisers no en
                        couragement to increase the number of meet ings, which the majority of
                        race-goers would no doubt appreciate. Amongst those present on Saturday no
                        lack of enthusiasm was shown, and in spite of a couple of runaway wins by
                        Kara Aslan, and the consistent Radium, the rest of the programme produced
                        some interest ing and keen sport. An excellent selection of music was
                        performed by the Band of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers under the conductorship
                        of Bandmaster A. Fawcett and it was with a feeling of regret, as one heard
                        the strains of the National Anthem, to think that another month would elapse
                        ere such an enjoyable atternoon would be repeated.</p>
