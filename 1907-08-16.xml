                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can
                        do, makes it pearly white, gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the
                        muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature’s Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to
                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or
                        the effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot
                        climates are so fatal.</p>

                        He was a Fellow in German at the University of Chicago in 1908-04, and was
                        awarded a first-class in the final examinations for the Oxford B.A. degree

                        Rhodes scholars," says Mr. Brooke. "It is now more than two years and a half
                        since the majority of them, each from different | State and totally
                        unacquainted, sailed from | Boston on the Canarder 'Ivernia,' with visit|ing
                        cards pinned to their coats to assist in their identification, and a great
                        fellowfeeling in their hearts at being companions in the unknown life before
                        them. </p>

                        themselves, to which the newcomer must adapt himself if he was to enter

                        eve of departure, after as long and intimate acquaintance as any good
                        American could desire, Oxford remains equally a mystery, though 'scouts' and
                        proctors, bumping races, schools,' and Gothic architecture are taken as
                        matters of course, and life goes on as smoothly and naturally as in any
                        American college.</p>
                    <p>"Nothing approaching &amp; definite report of the scholastic career of the
                        Rhodes scholars will be possible till the close of the present University
                        year, as it has been only in isolated, and somewhat exceptional cases that
                        the all deciding final examinations have been taken before the expiration of
                        the usual three years. It may, however, be said pretty confidently that such
                        results as so far have transpired have rather exceeded than fallen short of
                        anticipation ; that the initial distaste of the American students for the
                        unfamiliar and-at least superficially-rigid Oxford methods has in great
                        measure or wholly disappeared on better acquaintance, and that Oxford
                        sentiment as &amp; whole, tutorial and undergraduate, has regarded the
                        infusion of purely American modes and ideals of study with a kindliness
                        which in so conservative a community only, a very bold prophet would have
                        predicted. </p>
                    <p>"In the field of athletics the position of the Americans is more easily
                        estimated, for the standard of what is to be expected of them in this same
                        line seems, after a great deal of oscillation, to have reached a sane-and,
                        one may hope, a permanent-equilibrium. The overemphasis of the athletic
                        clause of the Rhodes will by the newspapers on both sides of the water,
                        together with the rather too suspicious débout in Oxford sport-when at the
                        freshmen's field day in their first term American Rhodes scholars won over
                        two-thirds of the events--- gave rise to some unfortunate misconceptions.
                        All sach misunderstandings have now entirely disappeared, and Oxford will no
                        more expect of every member of succeeding generations of Rhodes scholars
                        transcendent athletic prowess than it will require of each individual
                        extraordinary scholarship or peculiar moral, social or political
                        qualifications..... The Americans have taken readily to all the English
                        outdoor sports except cricket. They can't obtain the proper regard for it
                        for some reason. But they have given to the delighted aboriginal, small boy
                        the great American game of baseball, and their coolness on cricket is
                        forgiven them." </p>

                    <byline>NATIVE OPINION ON THE CRISIS</byline>
                    <p>To the EDITOR OF 'The "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE." Sir,-Will you kindly allow me a
                        short space in your columns, in order to contribute a few words on the
                        present financial crisis. The oriental proverb "what is one man's meat is
                        another man's poison" has, since the crisis paralysed commerce, been the
                        motto of many tradesmen who persuade the natives to believe that this
                        country is actually suffering through financial difficulties and that misery
                        is reigning everywhere. The object of these individuals is merely, by
                        spreading malicious rumours, to prepare the way for acquiring the wealth of
                        Egypt with as little trouble as possible. Directly speaking there is no
                        crisis that will hinder the financial progress of the country as long as the
                        cotton cultivation is flourishing, and as long as the present price of
                        cotton is secured. I declare these facts to make it known that if there is
                        any erisis it is confined to the brokers and stockholders who often miss the
                        mark by forgetting the old English saying "One bird in the hand is worth two
                        in the bush." believe the time has come to direct the attention of. the
                        Government authorities to a matter of the greatest importance, which if
                        neglected will bring the country into poverty. The merchants I am sure are
                        now straining every nerve to persuade the people that Egypt is destitute of
                        money. As we are now approaching the cotton season, and as the people are in
                        need of money to discharge their land taxation, fear is entertained that the
                        merchants, or rather village bankers, who used to lend the farmers money,
                        will not continue the same practice under such hard circumstances unless
                        farmers sell them their cotton at a very cheap price, notwithstanding that
                        the actual price of cotton varieties is published at Minet el-Bassal. The
                        insistence of the Government to receive its taxes, and the refusal of the
                        banks to lend money will probably aid the avarice of the greedy merchants. I
                        therefore believe it is the duty or the Government to carefully stop the
                        spreading about of such deceitful news and to take every means to prevent
                        such sources of misery and melancholy that might ruin the country. . *Yours

                        have attracted the attention of the officers in command of the detachment.

                    <head>FINANCIAL DEPRESSION IN LONDON. ITS CAUSES</head>
                    <byline>(From our financial correspondent.)</byline>
                    <p>The all-absorbing topic of conversation, not only in financial circles but
                        amongst people in the city generally, has been the entirely depressed
                        condition of the Stock Markets during the last week, and especially the
                        heavy fall in Consols and other gilt-edged securities. Never since 1848 has
                        the premier security touched such a low figure, and everybody is naturally
                        anxious to know the reason. No one seems to be able to state any definite
                        canse for this condition of more than lassitude which prevails in the
                        markets. </p>
                    <p>Several explanations are put forward, the more recent one being the serious
                        depreciation in American Stocks, which has followed as the result of the
                        heavy fine of over £5,000,000 imposed by the law Courts upon the Standard
                        Oil Company. This is accepted as a sign of what is to follow in the same
                        direction, and the expectation that similar action will be taken against
                        other corporations is causing the public to lose confidence, with the result
                        that one and all are desirous of realizing their stocks and shares. The
                        question of autumn gold requirements for Egypt is again brought forward as
                        another cause of the depression. Then again the want of confidence in the
                        home legislation of the present Government, which is in a very large measure
                        carried out at the instance of the Labour Party, has naturally made
                        Capitalists very nervous. There is also a good deal of disquiet amongst the
                        leading Railway Shareholders here owing to possible impending labour
                        troubles and this has caused the more conservative to realise. </p>
                    <p>We have given these several reasons which have been advanced by the thinking
                        community of the City, but in our opinion no single one of them is
                        sufficient to cause any such decline in prices, as has been going on for
                        some days past; but taken together however, and added to the nervousness
                        regarding the out come of affairs in Morocco they are in our opinion
                        sufficient to account for the present unsatisfactory state of affairs in the
                        City.</p>
                    <p>At the moment we see no silver lining to the heavy cloud which is overhanging
                        the financial world, and until prices reach such a level as to tempt
                        investors to become buyers instead ot sellers, we cannot hope to see any
                        improvement. Moreover, should the present weakness continue and the selling
                        proceed further, there is no prophesying what may happen, as it may
                        precipitate a monetary panic throughout the world, the consequences of which
                        would be too serious to contemplate. </p>
                    <p>It must not be forgotten that the Premier Security is very largely held by
                        our leading Financial Institutions, and although they have been written down
                        from time to time, they have now reached a point when they appear a very
                        ugly item in the balance sheets. We only mention this as being one direction
                        in which the present decline, if it continues may be a serious blow to
                        credit. </p>
                    <p>The "Times" in its City notes declares that the present condition is largely
                        brought about by monetary pressure in the United States and New York's
                        efforts to finance itself, and, as recorded above, it was an important cause
                        of the further hardening of discount rates here ; it thus had a very direct
                        effect on gilt-edged securities, which are always readily affected by
                        monetary considerations, with the result that a further sharp drop in
                        Consols jarred the already overstrained nerves of operators. </p>
                    <p>On the other hand, there appears to be no inconvenience owing to shortness of
                        money, and the Bank of England returns, though not quite as good as they
                        might be, certainly give no justification for the heavy depreciation which
                        has been going on during the past few days, added to which the trade
                        position may be described as splendid. The returns issued by the Board of
                        Trade yesterday shew that during July our Imports increased by £3,605,505 on
                        the very high total of July 1906, while the Exports have increased by no
                        less than £7,000,369, these amounting to £40,452,831. In ordinary times
                        these figures would have produced an excellent effect apon Railway Stocks,
                        but the attack of nerves has prevented the market from obtaining any benefit
                        from them, and the downward movement has in no way been mitigated by the
                        above figures.</p>

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA, BUILDING BYE LAWS</head>
                    <byline>BY R. WILLIAMS F.R.I.B.A.</byline>
                    <p>In a recent issue of the "Egyptian Gazette" the tentative building
                        regulations of the Municipality were formally advertised, together with an
                        intimation that they had already been published in the "Journal Officiel"
                        and that they will come into operation about the twenty fourth of August. </p>
                    <p>These advertised regulations differ but slightly from those set forth
                        originally and which were printed as an addendum to the third article of
                        these series.</p>
                    <p>A remark may however be made as regards the chimney regulations.
                        Notwithstanding the present excessive heat the Municipality is mindful that
                        the winters in Alexandria are becoming colder. Accordingly chimneys are
                        motioned but nothing is said as to fire places.</p>
                    <p>Now, the local mason has a very crude notion of a chimney; the usual form
                        being merely a hole cut through the wall at some suitable spot to be chosen
                        after the building is finished. The hole being cut, a pipe of iron or zinc
                        is fixed there to an excrescence against the wall. </p>
                    <p>In future however, these holes and pipes must have their positions settled
                        and shown on the plans to be submitted to the Municipality together with
                        details drawn to a scale of one tenth. </p>
                    <p>In the absence of information to the contrary we may presume that the
                        Municipality intends simply to regularise existing practise. Nothing is said
                        as to the formation of fire places and the size of flues. But perhaps fuller
                        details will be given to us when the regular byelaws, to which these are as
                        it were, heralds, are promulgated. The London Building Act has no less than
                        35 rules which are to be observed in the building of flues and fire places. </p>
                    <p>Let us now see what the Municipality wants by way of notice from persons
                        intending to build in the city of Alexandria. - I. A block plan showing
                        adjacent streets drainage ete. II. Sectional plans of each floor. Thus in a
                        house of four storeys four plans are required. III. At least two
                        sections--transverse and longitudinal. IV. Details of chimneys, V.
                        Elevations at least four, one for each side. VI. Enlarged details of
                        construction--possibly two sheets. VII. Specification about 30 pages. </p>
                    <p>All these documents are to be delivered in duplicate. This means that from
                        ten to twenty aneets or drawings will have to be prepared and two copies of
                        the specification. </p>
                    <p>The expense entailed will be considerable, and proprietors who are chary of
                        employing architects at all and who, even when they do, are loath to pay
                        reasonable fees will justly complain of this additional imposition. A client
                        of mine is already complaining of the extra cost. </p>
                    <p>Besides this there is another grave objection to the depositing of an
                        architects designs, details and specifications in the public archives,
                        especially is this so when we know that in Egypt there is a pernicious
                        custom of allowing officials, on occasion, to practise on their own account.
                        I have met some such in consultation and have been informed by others that
                        occasionally they can undertake commissions outside of their official
                        duties. An undesirable and reprehensible practice.</p>
                    <p>We will now consider the various points set forth at the end of the last
                        paper published in the "Egyptian Gazette" on July 26th and in the following
                        order. </p>
                    <p>1. The laying out of streets and of drainage and sewerage. </p>
                    <p>In the building of a new town or the remodelling of an old one, next to the
                        choice of site, which can only be exercised in the former case, there is
                        nothing more important and conducive to the health and comfort of the
                        inhabitants than wide, well-paved streets with good sewers below and
                        efficient drainage leading thereto from the houses contiguous to the
                        streets. </p>
                    <p>A walk, or rather, a series of darts and dodges along the narrow footway of
                        Cherif Pacha Street during the busy hours of the day, and a walk toward the
                        sea along one of the small streets leading to the new sea wall when the wind
                        blows inwards, amply prove the discomfort of narrow streets and the
                        insalubrious odours emanating from ill-arranged sewerage.</p>
                    <p>The narrowness of Cherif Pacha St eet exemplifies the narrowness and
                        shortness of view with which, since the broad days of the Grecian street
                        planners, our ancestors were inflicted whenever they proceeded to set out
                        the lines of a town. </p>
                    <p>To them the immediate needs, and not even those in their fullness, were
                        thought of. No thought was given to the inevitable increase of population
                        and of traffic. </p>
                    <p>This want of foresight on the part of the narrow minded "fathers” of cities
                        has cost to their posterity untold millions sterling for street widening.
                        During the last fifty years, street and bridge improvements in London of
                        have cost to the ratepayers a nett sum of over sixteen million (£16,246,521,
                        or approximately £325,000 per annum. </p>
                    <p>The above figures are taken from the Report of the Royal Commission upon the
                        means of al Locomotion and Transport in London which e contains a vast mass
                        of evidence and information in eight stout volumes, (blue books) replete
                        with hundreds of plans, maps and diagrams. </p>
                    <p>The inquiry of the commissioners extended for a period of over two years and
                        embraced </p>
                </div>
                <div type="article">
                    <p>the exhaustive examination of the street and general traffic accommodation of
                        London and "Greater London," covering an area of some 693 square miles (an
                        area equal to the distance from Alexandria to Cairo and over five miles
                        wide). It also includes an examination of the American cities of New York,
                        Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, and of the European cities of Vienna,
                        Bada Pesth, Prague, Cologne, Dresden, Berlin, Brussels and Paris </p>
                    <p>A most interesting feature of the Report upon the cities abroad is the series
                        of plans of the city of Paris dating from 1798 to 1889 showing incidentally
                        the outgrowth of the city and the street improvements carried out in those
                        years and especially those under the guidance of the broad-minded Prefecto
                        the Seine, M. Hausmann. </p>
                    <p>The recorded cost of these improvements goes only as far back as the year 71,
                        the records probably having been lost in the revolutionary fires of that
                        year, since which time there has been spent on new streets in Paris no less
                        a sum than £24,772,034.</p>
                    <p>Auent the Paris improvements the Com-LA missioners record the following
                        interesting information, "It appears, that in 1798 a commission of artists
                        laid down the various improvements which then seemed to be desirable, and
                        these are shown on the plan No. 2." </p>
                    <p>Here surely is a good precedent for Alex andria. Let the Municipality search
                        for a committee of artists of sufficiently broad views - avoiding always the
                        modern expert who is often afraid of his own opinion and doubtless they will
                        be forthcoming. Especially would a committee of this kind be of service in
                        formulating ideas for the treatment and development of the land rei claimed
                        and otherwise in connection with the new sea wall, and for the planning of
                        new streets and widening of others. </p>
                    <p>The widening of Cherit Pacha Street, would be a matter well worth their
                        consideration. If it were possible to remove the block of li buildings
                        between Cherif Pacha and Tewfik Streets and the Boarse at one end, the
                        Caracol at the other splendid street might result, the whole width of
                        Mohammed Ali square leading up to an improved bifurcation of the Moharrem
                        Bey and Port Rosetta Streets. Trees might be planted in this wi"dened street
                        and possibly arrangements made for two lines of noiseless trams. But this,
                        as desirable as it seems, may be too drastic an improvement, yet it cannot
                        be gainsaid that Cherif Pacha Street is exceedingly narrow and altogether
                        disproportionate to the amount of business carried on and the volume of
                        traffic which passes through it. </p>
                    <p>That there is "a loss caused by want of travelling facilities” the Report to
                        which allusion is made above, amply shows, but persons who wish to go about
                        their business in other than the slow eastern method may judge of this for
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>An alternative mode of widening this street might be found by setting back
                        the north side, but this would probably be a process equally costly and
                        would take a longer time to settle. Many of the houses having been rebuilt,
                        endless negotiations would have to be entered into as to compensation etc. </p>
                    <p>In London, where the greater part of the property is built on the leasehold
                        system the widening of streets proceeds as the leases "fall in" or
                        terminate, the lease having usually a rebuilding clause. But the process is
                        a slow one as may be judged by the snail-like progress of the widening of
                        the Strand and Fleet street in London. </p>
                    <p>Owing to the low-lying situation of Alexandria the relief of traffic by
                        shallow underground tubes would be deemed to be hardly practicable, yet it
                        would not be too difficult a task for our modern engineers to overcome. The
                        depth of the tramway under the new King's Way is about five metres from the
                        crown of the road to the tram rail level. It is only in the lower levels of
                        Alexandria that water is reached before that depth. </p>
                    <p>As my space is narrow, like many of the streets of Alexandria, it is
                        impossible that I can deal adequately with the report on the streets of
                        London and other towns mentioned. I have called attention to its invaluable
                        contents, containing as it does the result of the labours of a commission to
                        which the late Sir Benjamin Baker, Sir J. Wolfe-Barry and Mr. Barclay
                        Parsons, acted as an advisory Board of Engineers. The report should
                        certainly be consulted by the advisors in these matters to the Municipality. </p>

                        Mansfield Clarke vacated. General Grant served in the 4th Hussars from Feb.
                        17, 1869, to Jan. 20, 1886, and was then promoted into the 7th Dragoon
                        Guards, which he commanded until Marek 31, 1891. He became a major general
                        April 1, 1900, and a lieutenant general April 21, 1906. He was Inspector
                        General of Cavalry in India, 1898-98, Inspector General of Cavalry in the
                        United Kingdom, 1898-1902, and lately commanded the oth Division, Southern
                        Command, Dover. Whilst doing duty in Egypt he quelled a mutiny of Turkish
                        soldiers serving in the Egyptian Army, and captured the mutineers in 1884,
                        receiving for that service the brevet of lieutenant-colonel. He served in
                        the Nile and Suakin Expeditions, 1884-85, in command of the Mounted Infantry
                        (mentioned in despatches, medal with two clasps, Khedive's star, and C.B.).

                    <byline>IMPORTS DURING JUNE</byline>
                    <p>Compared with the corresponding month last year the imports of LE. 1,892,182
                        during Jupe showed an increase of LE 246, 289. There are singularly few
                        articles in the imports of which a decrease is to be noted, and, in spite of
                        the bad times Egypt is passing through financially, it is pleasing to see a
                        steady increase in the majority of cases.</p>
                    <p>BUILDING MATERIALS -A large increase of building wood is seen in the month's
                        figures over last year, the figures being now LE 84,980 instead of L.E.
                        88,376, being now more than double. </p>
                    <p>COAL --The figures show a scarcely perceptible decrease. </p>
                    <p>COFFER. There has been a shrinkage from LE 20,000 to LE 9.000. </p>
                    <p>FURNITURE. -The total value of the imports. for the month were L.E. 41,000
                        against LE. 29,000 for the corresponding period last year. England now ousts
                        Austria from the leading position with a value of LR 11,000 against LE.
                        8,400. </p>
                    <p> IRON AND IRON GOODB. - There has been a big increase to chronicle here, the
                        value for June being L.E.190,000 against LE 124,000 during June last year.
                        England just beats Belgium as the principal exporter to these shores. </p>
                    <p>LOCOMOTIVES.-The past month has seen &amp; decrease from LE. 8,600 to LE
                        9,500. </p>
                    <p>MANCHESTER Goods. -Cotton fabrics were returned at a value of LE. 234,000
                        which is a slight drop from the similar period last year. </p>
                    <p>Marze-There has been a big drop in the maize importation figures. Whereas
                        last year we could point to an import value of LE. 16,300 in June, we have
                        now paltry LE. 500 in front of us </p>
                    <p>PETROLEUM.-Jane 1906 saw an import of LE. 10,000 in value. This year the same
                        article has a value of LE 85,000.</p>
                    <p>POSTAL PACKETS --- The post office seems to be made more use as of late, the
                        total value of the goods passing through it is LE 87,000 against L. 58,000
                        the previous June. </p>
                    <p>SHERP.-LE. 8,000 represented their value last June, this year it is LE
                        27,000. </p>
                    <p>Britain's SHARE.--The figures keep very steady and there is little scope for
                        the pessimists or optimists to raise their voices Britain maintains her
                        average and has just under 38% of the total trade, which compares very
                        favourably with the 12% of Turkey, the nearest opponent. </p>
                    <p>EXPORTS. </p>
                    <p>COTTON.-Spot market showed more sigis of activity during the month and
                        holders maintained firm prices for good qualities : the existing stock
                        almost entirely composed of cotton over. </p>
                    <p>The premium of November contracts over July reached 1 dollar during the
                        middle of the month, but owing to increasing demand for spot cotton the
                        margin narrowed to 5/8 dollars at the close. </p>
                    <p>The crop reports continue satisfactory and a good supply of early cotton is
                        expected from Upper Egypt. The Delta erop is quite as forward as usual and
                        there is every prospect of a erop as good as last year. </p>

                    <head>NATIONALISATION IN EGYPT. </head>
                    <p>Writers who refer to nationalisation in Egypt says a correspondent to the
                        "Nottingham Guardian," may learn something of it from Warburton's book. “The
                        Crescent and the Cross." I have not the book at hand, but it says that about
                        a century ago land, agriculture, and manufactures were nationalised and
                        managed by Government 40 or 50 years. The farmers farmed as directed by
                        officials, and took their produce to the Government store for Government
                        prices ; and mills for making cotton staffs, cloth, guns, sugar, &amp;c.,
                        were worked compulsorily for Government wages, which were very low, yet not
                        low enough to make the products so cheap or so good as those made elsewhere,
                        and the scheme failed and ended in debts that burden Egypt still. Tens of
                        thousands of the people were nsed up, but equality under Government and its
                        officers Was achieved, and this is the great object of social reforms and
                        progress, for it matters little what we suffer if all suffer alike ander
                        universal suffrage. It is said that. </p>
                    <p>We would rather be Genteelly damned beside a duke - Than saved in vulgar
                        company. Much more so if none at all were saved, for it is Heaven that makes
                        bell het. It seems mistake to suppose that nationalisation of the means of
                        production has been tried only in Egypt. A few years ago Mr. Lane and other
                        Australians carefully formed an admirable plan for trying it, with carefully
                        chosen settlers and plenty of capital, in a great settlement in Paraguay,
                        and an account of its success would be more instructive than the Egyptian
                        scheme. </p>
