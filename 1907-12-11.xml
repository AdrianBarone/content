                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For
                        information apply to Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co.,
                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's
                        “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                        <p>so neither of them were guilty of corruption:</p>
                        <p>The most important witness for the prosecution</p>
                        <p>was Mahmdnd Neghib, who was under Safwat’s</p>

                        <p>this to Sir, Massie Blomfield and then to the</p>

                        <p>The chief of the Parquet said that in the</p>
                        <p>beginning of 1907 the Finance Ministry found</p>
                        <p>out the corruption in the Ports and Lights and</p>
                        <p>this is due to the authority, given to this</p>

                        <p>is the why the officinls such as Spiro Bey</p>
                        <p>etc., began to follow the which has led to</p>
                        <p>the present case.</p>
                        <p>The Finatice Ministry then sent a delegate to</p>

                        <p>of corraption was from Spiro Bey and Attiah</p>

                        <p>Then the chief of Parquet pointed out how</p>
                        <p>the first witness paid a bribe to Attiah who is</p>
                        <p>the assistant of Spiro Bey.</p>
                        <p>The chief of the Parquet is of opinion that</p>

                            <p>Sir,</p>
                            <p>A crisis bas arrived in the affairs of the</p>
                            <p>Egyptian Constractious Limited and much, if</p>
                            <p>not all, depends on the decision which the</p>
                            <p>shareholders will take at the extraordinary</p>

                            <p>the 21st inst. At the beginning of this year</p>
                            <p>the company was in a most flourishing condi-</p>
                            <p>tion and had excellent prospects, During the</p>
                            <p>months that have elapsed a great amount of</p>
                            <p>work has been carried out and, presumably,</p>
                            <p>paid for. Nevertheless the shareholders find</p>
                            <p>that the present Board of Directors has thought</p>
                            <p>fit to convene this meeting for the purpose of</p>
                            <p>disposing of those branches of the basiness,</p>
                            <p>which.are actually carrying on the work of the</p>
                            <p>company. All shareholders ought therefore to</p>
                            <p>insist on s strict investigation of the business</p>
                            <p>carried ont during the present year, They also</p>
                            <p>should look into the conditions, ander which</p>

                            <p>I am, Sir, </p>

                            <p>Sir,</p>
                            <p>Referring to the notice convening an ex-</p>

                            <p>capital, oce is amazed that any directors</p>
                            <p>shonld place sach proposals before a presam-</p>
                            <p>ably intelligent body of shareholders. Not only</p>
                            <p>did they give us only a few months ago a most</p>
                            <p>glowing account of the fature prospects of the</p>
                            <p>associated businesses, but pointed out the</p>
                            <p>undoubtedly aniqae position the company</p>
                            <p>held in the building and engineering trades</p>
                            <p>owing to the sequisition of two private con-</p>
                            <p>cerns. Without a farther word of explanation</p>
                            <p>the shareholders are now asked to authorise</p>
                            <p>a sweeping reduction of capital and the re-</p>
                            <p>sale (probably at an enormous loss) of the</p>
                            <p>businesses which were going to do so much for</p>
                            <p>the company. Surely, before submitting such</p>
                            <p>proposals the board should have given some</p>
                            <p>statement of account and the reasons for the</p>
                            <p>step they propose? Do-they want to rush</p>
                            <p>their proposals through without explanations</p>
                            <p>or discussion? In the present deplorable posi-</p>
                            <p>tion of the company the shareholders should</p>
                            <p>be in possession of full details for their very</p>
                            <p>careful consideration before being asked to ar-</p>
                            <p>rive at any decision. We shareholders are</p>
                            <p>pleased at the opportunity of meeting the</p>
                            <p>board and enquiring as to the truth of the</p>
                            <p>many anpleasant ramoors being circulated</p>
                            <p>about the company and its management, and</p>
                            <p>to the effect that even if the board’s resolu-</p>
                            <p>tions are carried, the company will be left</p>
                            <p>without working capital. It is certainly es-</p>
                            <p>seotial that the shareholders should pull to-</p>
                            <p>gether in this matter by attending the meet-</p>

                        <p>to-day. But why shoald the Atlantic have the</p>

                        <p>been running across the Atlantic for several</p>
                        <p>years now, whereas the Mediterranean service</p>

                        <p>We left Marseilles at 1.30 p.m. on Saturday </p>
                        <p>but the first day’s ron was rather unsatisfac-</p>
                        <p>tory, owing, I am told, to bad stoking. Up to</p>
                        <p>midday on Saturday we made 395 knots.</p>
                        <p>following day’s run, however, was 456 knots, </p>
                        <p>and between midday Monday and midday</p>
                        <p>yesterday we covered 458 knots, thus leaving</p>
                        <p>us 89 knots to ras, and this we did in four</p>
                        <p>hours, for it was at 4 p.m. that the engines</p>
                        <p>were stopped just outside Alexandria harbour</p>
                        <p>to await the pilot. In considering these runs it</p>
