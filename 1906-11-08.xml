                <p> DOES PAN-ISLAMISM EXIST? </p>
                <p>  In discussing the Pan-Islamic bogey, which the Head season revived from a long
                    slumber, the Constantinople correspondent of the "Tribune remarks that the
                    evidence brought forward in support of the contention that "Yildiz Palace has
                    become the head centre of a great organization which aims at embracing the whole
                    Mussulman world, and has certainly succeeded in spreading its ramifications bver
                    a great part of it” utterly fails to support it </p>
                <p> The strongest evidence adduced," he says is derived from recent occurrences in
                    Egypt. What it amounts to is this: that Egypt having been taken out of the
                    control of Turkey, the ulema of that country and the Moslem population generally
                    were urged, both on the occasion of the naval demonstrations regarding Tabah and
                    the unfortunate 1 incident at Denishwai, to show their dis </p>
                <p> satisfaction with British interference in Egypt, and that to a certain extent
                    they showed such digestisfaction. But there is no necessary connexion between
                    such display and a PanIslamic movement. </p>
                <p> "Everyone can readily understand that the substitution of British for Turkish
                    control in Egypt gave rise to very great irritation among the Turkish official
                    class, both here and in Egypt. It could not have been otherwise. Recall the
                    circumstances. Egypt was by far the largest and the most important of the
                    tributary states under Turkish rule. When England first determined to land
                    troops in Egypt, the Sultan was invited to send his troops and to make the
                    occupation a, joint one. For reasons well known he refused, and, to the
                    astonishment of Yildiz, British troops entered alone. Abdul Hamid soon
                    recognized that 'the blow to his reputation as suzerain was heavy ; and Mr.
                    "Gladstone and Lord Salisbury having each pledged themselves again and again to
                    leave Egypt, Sir Henry Drummond Wolff was sent to negotiate thin conditions on
                    which British troops should withdraw A convention was agreed to. The last
                    soldier was to be out of the county within seven years. Then a blunder way made,
                    owing to external influences upon Yildiz, and the convention which Drummond
                    Wolff had drawn, and which was accepted by the Grand Vizier and by England, was
                    rejected by the Sultan. .. </p>
                <p> "England had now just cause to be offended, and when &amp; year or so later
                    Abdul Hamid proposed that negotiations should be reopened on the basis of the
                    Drummond Wolff Convention Lord Salisbury refused. From that time, or, to be more
                    precise, from the time when France took possession of Tunis, no statesman of
                    either party renewed the declaration that England would leave Egypt. Add to all
                    this the facts that the enormous prosperity of Egypt has produced awkward
                    comparisons with the backwardness of Turkey, that there is a large Druse and
                    Moslem emigration from Syria into Egypt, and that many Turkish officials who
                    were enrichin selves at the cost of the Egyptians have lost their means of
                    plunder, and it will be seen that the irritation of Yildiz does not require the
                    suggestion of Pan-Islamism. to explain its existence. | "It is said tha,
                    Islamism during the last quarter of a century. has made many new converts,
                    especially, indeed almost exclusively, in Central Africa. No one to my knowledge
                    has ever suggested that the conversion of fetish worshippers to a belief in one
                    God has been the result of missionary efforts from Turkey. But, assuming the
                    statement to be true, it is far from showing either that there is a Pan-Islamic
                    movement, or that such a movement is directed by. Abdul Hamid, Moslemismi being,
                    liko Christianity, &amp; great missionary religion, there is in it, and always
                    has been, a movement for its propagation. Since the time of Mahomed it has
                    constantly happened that its great and ennobling monotheistic teaching has
                    appealed to uncivilized men. If more converts have been made of late than in
                    preceding years, it is because the opening up of Africa has brought the black
                    races into contact with Arab and other Moslem traders. In this limited sense
                    there has been an increase in the number of Moslems. But to assert that this
                    shows that there is a Pan-Islamic movement beyond the ordinary one which has
                    been going on during centuries is unwarranted by the evidence. </p>
                <p> "The massacre of Christians in Bulgaria and the unparalleled slaughter of
                    Armenians are adduced as evidence of Pan-Islamism. As to the first, it took
                    place before Abdul Hamid came to the throne. It must, therefore, be excluded as
                    evidence against any such movement directed by him. He, however, must bear the
                    reproach of the merciless slaughter of Armenians, and tho cruol persecution to
                    which that pel ple has been subjected. But the outrages which all Europe justly
                    condemned were not due to any Pan-Islamic movement. Though thousands were
                    slaughtered by orders from Yildiz, the motive cannot be called reli. gious. The
                    outrages were participated in by a Moslem population from motives mainly of
                    plunder. The justification offered to the barbarians' who killed their
                    neighbours and stole their property was that their intended victims were in
                    revolt. The statement was in almost every case false. It was, of course, readily
                    believed by people to whom it furnished &amp; legal excuse for stealing all that
                    they could lay their hands on. The motive was not so much religious or fanatical
                    as mercenary. Moslems rarely, if ever, killed Armenians merely because they were
                    Christians, but mostly to gain possession of what. those in authority told them
                    they might take. Whatever were the motives which led to the Armenian massacres,
                    and it is not difficult to find them, they do not give evidence of any
                    Pan-İslamic movement. </p>
                <p> "The construction of a railway to Mecca is adduced as one of the results of the
                    Pan. Islamic movement. It is due in part, possibly altogether, to the initiative
                    of Abdul Hamid. But anyone who knows what was the cost of the annual pilgrimage
                    to Mecca, pilgrimage there being one of the "five pillars" of Islam and
                    therefore obligatory, will marvel that such &amp; trailway was not thought 6f
                    long before. The marvel will be the greater when it is remembered that for fifty
                    years Turkey has been constantly at war with Arab tribes. The only other
                    evidence adduced in favour of Pan-Islamism is the attempt made in Afghanistan,
                    and, perhaps, elsewhere, to lead the Moslems of those countries to make common
                    cause with Turkey against Great Britain. Such attempts were undoubtedly made. In
                    1881 or 1882, when Lord Dufferin was here, he learned that a newspaper called
                    Peik </p>
                <p> Islam" was being printed at Yildiz for circulaItion in India during our troubles
                    withi Afghanistan. Lord Dufferin was essentially a strong Ambassador, and he had
                    a strong Liberal Government behind him. The representations made by him at
                    Yildiz at once put a stop to all'attempts of that kind. It should be remem.
                    bered that at the time there was very great soreness at Yildiz against England.
                    The firmness of Mr. Goschen over the Dulcigno question was only one of several
                    causes of such irritation. That an attempt was made to use the co-religionists
                    of the Turks against us was not unnatural, but such attempt does not show the
                    existence of a Pan-Islamic sentiment." </p>

                    <p>GONDOKORO TO LAKE ALBERT.</p>
                    <p>Of the grant of L E. 15,000 for a levelled survey of the Nile from Gondokoro to
                        Lake Albert nothing has yet been spent, but it is hoped that the work will be
                        taken in hand this winter. The kendies of the Public Works Department for the
                        several projects for controlling the Upper Nile are progressing with such
                        rapidity that it seems probable that, in a year's time at most, it will be in a
                        position to advise the Egyptian Government as to a definite selection from among
                        them. Meanwhile the authorities have been much bandicapped by their lack of
                        accurate knowledge regarding the levels of the river throughout its course, more
                        especially from its sources to the second Cataract. Much has been done, and much
                        is being done to rectify their ignorance in this respect. In Egypt proper,
                        precision levelling is in progress. In the Cataract region, the survey parties
                        above mentioned are at work, while, between Khartoam and Gondokoro, the officers
                        of the Sudan Irrigation Service are carrying a line of levels up the White Nile
                        and the Bohr-el-Gebel. South of Gondokoro,however, there is a complete blank,
                        beyond the rough surveys of the river made by Sir William Garstin and others
                        travellers. No levels exist and, beyond the information afforded by a certain
                        number of barometric readings - avowedly inaccurate - we know nothing whatever
                        regarding the slope and fall of the river. It is this portion of the Nile valley
                        then that it is desired to have surveyed and levelled, at an early date.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the desirability of the work upon technical grounds-seeing that the
                        construction of a regulator at the Albert lake may possibly be taken in hand
                        simultaneously to the improvement of the channel in the swamps-such a survey is
                        highly desirable upon a scientific grounds. Considering the importance of the
                        Nile to Egypt and to the Sudan, the non-completion of such an undertaking must
                        be held somewhat as a reproach to the administration of Public Works in
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The work will be commenced this winter. Levels will be carried across from the
                        Victoria to the Albert lake, and thence down the Bahr-el-Gebel to Gondekoro.</p>
                    <p>As the water-level cf Lake Victoria bas been a connected by spirit-levelling with
                        the sea at Mombasa, we shall, when the chain is completed, have a complete
                        circuit of levels from the Mediterranean-up the Nile valley and down the Uganda

                            note that an increasing number of men are being brought out from home to fill
                            official positions as engineers. This is, perhaps, a reason for the outcry which

                            strict inquiry. The way in which numbers of them have grown rich while holding
                            official positions is nothing short of marvellous, and their places might well
                            be filled with Englishmen, to the advantage of the country and in the interests

                        <p>Apropos of the cultivation of Egyptian cotton in Sind, it appears on official
                            authority, says the 'Capital" (Calcatta), that one of the principal difficulties
                            the zemindar has to contend with is that of obtaining an adequate apply of
                            labour for the cultivation of the staple. The ordinary labourer in Sind, it is
                            said. dislikes the additional and unfamiliar trouble involved in the proper
                            cultivation of Egyptian cotton. The zemindar is therefore hard put to secure
                            efficient labour and has to pay well for it, and to take unwanted risks. The
                            Bombay authorities have accordingly intimated to the Bombay mill industry that
                            if they desire to see the Sind Egyptian cotton experiments accomplish the great
                            results anticipated for them they must cooperate with Government in risking a
                            little expenditure in money and effort in securing the crop and so encouraging
                            the cultivator. A promising feature in the position is that the Bombay
                            Government are hopeful of getting railway communication into the heart of the
                            tract where Egyptian cotton is being grown in Sind at an fi early date.</p>

                        say, he has recovered, but he doubtless feels compelled to resign on account of
                        his advanced years, which must prevent him from carrying on his work with that
                        great zeal and energy, which he has amply demonstrated during his chaplaincy in

                    <p>PROSPERITY.</p>
                    <p>The large withdrawals of gold from the Bank of England for Egypt have formed
                        an import ant topic for discussion in the London financial Press during the
                        past few weeks. In a recent article on the subject, the "Financier" gives
                        the following able statement of the facts regarding the position :--</p>
                    <p>The only trouble in Egypt, financially, is the rapidly growing prosperity of
                        the country.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the recent large withdrawals of gold from the Bank of
                        England on Egyptian account there has been some apprehension that more of
                        the metal might have to go the same way--even large amounts--and that,
                        consequently, more stringent conditions than ever might supervere in the
                        London money market. As the result of enquiries in banking-circles connected
                        with Egypt it may be said that, although further remittances of gold to that
                        country may have to be made, it is not very likely that they will aggregate
                        more than three-quarters of a million sterling, or, at the outside, a
                        million. Also it does not follow that the whole of this will be drawn from
                        England. France, having, actually and relatively, a much larger supply of
                        gold available than the United Kingdom, could, if need be, send it to Egypt
                        with less effort. It is not expected that this will happen on a large scale,
                        but it is probable there will be some consignments from that quarter.</p>
                    <p>A representative of the "Financier," in the course of several interviews with
                        banking authorities, elicited an interesting exposé of the situation with
                        respect to the need for gold in Egypt in relation to the cotton crop One
                        gentleman, whose description of the true position of affairs may be taken as
                        typical, said:-</p>
                    <p>"There has been, seemingly, quite a mistaken idea as to the meaning of those
                        consignments of gold to Egypt. Some financial writers appear to be in
                        ignorance of the fact that every year at this season large consignments of
                        gold are made to Cairo, mainly in connection with the cotton crop. It is so
                        expected and so regular an operation that it usually excites the very
                        slightest notice. This time, however, for two or three reasons, it has been
                        made very conspicuous. It happened that the gold was withdrawn at such a
                        moment and in such a way that it was associated with the declaration of a 6
                        per cent. Bank rate. And the total amount withdrawn up to date is more than
                        it has been hitherto.</p>
                    <p>"There are several reasons for this, but there are two in particular, The
                        Egyptian</p>
                    <p>cotton crop this year is a very big one, estimated at seven millions of
                        cantars. Consequently that fact alone would mean more money-more gold
                        brought into the cöntry, to pay for it - than has been the case hitherto.
                        Then there was the partial destruction of the cotton crop in the United
                        States. It is impossible to say even now what the approximate damage really
                        amounted to. The bull operators of course made the most of their opportunity
                        and put up prices as high as possible, but the damage was severe, and there
                        will be a certain shortage; consequently a rise in the price of cotton is a
                        legitimate result. The quotations for Egyptian cotton have been</p>
                    <p>considerably affected, so that not only shall we have a very large output,
                        but a higher price for the product. This will mean a larger amount of gold
                        than heretofore to ‘lift' the crop.</p>
                    <p>"In those circumstances it requires no argument to show that Egypt will,
                        during the next twelve months, be in a position to make perhaps greater
                        progress than she has ever done before in any one year. At any rate, she
                        will be exceedingly prosperous, and that property will, naturally, have a
                        certain stimulating effect in this country."</p>
                    <p>"May I ask if you can tell me how it was that the Bank of England appeared
                        not to be aware of these requirements of Egypt until, as it were, the last
                        moment.?"</p>
                    <p>"I suppose that the management do not or in this case did not take sufficient
                        cognisance of what was going on in the outside financial world beyond what
                        was communicated to them officially. If they had possessed the knowledge it
                        is to be surmised they would have put up the rate 5 per cent. some weeks
                        ago. That would have been far better from every point of view, and would
                        have avoided the equeeze which has been brought about by the 6 percent.
                        rate-an abnormal one which, it is to be hoped, will not last very long."</p>
                    <p>"Do you consider it probable that the success of this season's cotton crop in
                        Egypt will - stimulate the planting of a large acreage ?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes; I should say it certainly will."</p>
                    <p>"May there not be a consequent slump in the price for the 1907 orop ?"</p>
                    <p>"It by no means follow. At present the fine | long staple cotton grown in
                        Egypt cannot be raised successfully in any other country in the world. And I
                        believe the demand for it is steadily growing. Not only in Europe, but in
                        the United States, Egyptian cotton is being used in constantly increasing
                        quantities.".</p>
                    <p>"If the price were reduced, do you think the consumption would be much
                        increased?</p>
                    <p>"I doubt it. But at present there appears to be no need to reduce the price.
                        There are, of course, different qualities of the fibre produced in Egypt,
                        but the best appears it be always sure of a market. In the Sadat there is a
                        certain small quantity of short staple cotton grown, more like iho American
                        variety but I do not know whether it is exported a all; the entire quantity
                        raised is very trifling I am not an expert on cotton, but I understand the
                        cultivators consider the soil and climate of Egypt particularly adapted for
                        the long staples.</p>

                        Personally, I look forward to the indefinite development of Egypt for many years

                        anything which has yet been done. The exports of our gold to Cairo should be
