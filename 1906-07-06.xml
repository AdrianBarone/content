                    <p>NEJD SUCCESSION DISPUTE.</p>
                    <p> The “Morning Post's" Berlin correspondent writes that German advices from
                        Constantinople state that the death of Ibn-el Rsachid, the Sultan of Nejd,
                        which was reported some six weeks ago, is now officially confirmed.
                        According to the "Frankfurter Zeitung," the Porte is fitting out twenty-six
                        battalions, which are to be taken from the first and second levies of the
                        Macedonian Rodifs, for an expedition to the Sultanate of Nejd in the hope of
                        securing the succession to the son of Ibn-el-Raschid and protecting him from
                        the aspirations of Muberek, the Sheikh of Koweit. The expedition will be
                        under the command of Pertev Pachs, who is, described as one of General von
                        der Golte's most brilliant pupils. Pertev Pachs, who acted as Turkish
                        Attaché at the Japanese headquarters during the great war, has taken up his
                        quartere in Bagdad. </p>
                    <p>The circumstance that Mubarok is regarded as an agent of Great Britain
                        explains the interest which the announcement of the action contemplated by
                        the Porte arouses in Germany. It has always been imagined in Germany that
                        Great Britain, by supporting Mubarek against the Sultan of Nejd, has
                        committed a grave political mistake, but it is feared that the death of
                        Ibn-el-Raschid may now place an entirely different aspect upon affairs in
                        Central Arabia and result in Mubarek definitely gaining the upper hand in a
                        quarter of the world which, embracing as it does the future terminus of the
                        Bagdad Railway, possesses a peculiar interest for Germany. </p>
                    <p>The "Vossisobe Zsitang" asserts that descendants of the Dynasty of Ibn Saud,
                        which reigned in Nejd before the time of Ibn-el-Raachid, are living in
                        Koweit and India, and it is anxious to know if it is the intention of the
                        British, in the event of Mubarak being victorious, to instal one of them
                        Saltan in Nejd. It supposes not, but observes that they will doubtless be
                        used as pawns in the struggle for supremacy in Central Arabia. </p>
                    <p>In the determination of the Porte to fight for the son of Ibn-el-Raschid, the
                        Liberal organ places little hope. Three years ago, it observes, the Turkish
                        Government, after sending a gunboat to Koweit and ordering the despatch
                        thither of a large detachment of troops from Bagdad, beat a hasty retreat in
                        view of the threatening attitude of the British authorities, and it,
                        therefore, doubts if in the present instance Pertev Pasha will ever be
                        permitted to advance so far as Nejd. </p>
                    <p>We doubt whether the British Government takes the slightest interest in Nejd,
                        always provided that the status quo is respected at Koweit. It really makes
                        no difference whether an Ibn Raschid, an Ibn Sand, or Turkish Pasha roles at
                        Hail or Riadh as long as no attempt is made to seize the port of entry to
                        Mesopotamia and Central Arabia. Our contemporary the "Vossische Zeitung"
                        apparently forgets that Abdel Aziz ibn Saui is the right ful heir to, as he
                        is the actual ruler of the greater part of the Nejd, and Great Britain is
                        unlikely to make confusion worse confounded by adding another to the list of
                        Emirs and Chieftains whose struggles in the wastes of Arabia seem as
                        constant and as purposeless as the battles of the kites and crows. </p>

                        <p>Father's Tragic Death</p>
                        <p>Having received information yesterday that a young native, living at
                            Hadra, had beaten his father to death, the police authorities promptly
                            appeared on the scene and opened an inquiry. The evidence showed that
                            the son, who is only 15 years of age, fell into a violent rage while
                            giving some food to his two little Brothers. The father, an old man of
                            68, scolded him and the boy ran from the house. The father picked up a
                            stone and attempted to throw it at him, but failed and fell down dead.
                            The body was sent to hospital for a post mortem examination, which
                            showed that the death of the old man, who was found slightly wounded in
                            the neck, was due to some internal disease, probably heart failure.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. Sir,-The attempt of a small
                            section of the House of Commons to obtain the intervention of the
                            Secretary for Foreign Affairs for the commutation of the sentence of
                            death upon the four leaders of the dastardly outrage against British
                            officers at Denishwai is exceedingly regrettable, as are also the
                            opinions which were so freely expressed in the Lobby by a few. It is, of
                            course, well-known to all Britishers in this country that Mr. Dillon and
                            his followers are but governed by unruly impulses of the moment, and we
                            also have the assurance of the home Press that the sentences were
                            universally approved. We, at any rate, recognize such interference as
                            ill. timed and would only regard it as an unjustified effort by an
                            insignificant party, were it not that it will have its ill effect upon
                            the country. A grossly exaggerated account, enlarging upon the sympathy
                            which the great ruling power of England has for the fellaheen in their
                            action, will be disseminated through the provinces by a certain section
                            of the vernacular Press, and will persuade the villagers that their
                            comrades of Danishwai are regarded by the English public as having had
                            great provocation and have suffered unduly for their impetuous rashness.
                            They will be led to believe that the English officer is their enemy and
                            regards them as his slave, and that British justice in Egypt is a thing
                            of the past. </p>
                        <p>It is our duty, therefore, and the duty of our Press to emphasize the
                            support which the authorities in Egypt have received from the home
                            Government in the matter and to impress upon the Egyptian public the
                            horror with which the news of the outrage was received in Great Britain.
                            We must point out that England has accepted the sentences as severe, but
                            is, convinced of the justice thereof. and is prepared to agree to even
                            sterner measures in the event of any similar occurrence in future, I am,

                        <p>"The affair is a simple one and may be summed up as follows:- The people
                            of Denishwai did not seek the officers in their camp, but the officers
                            went to their village, Denishwai, to shoot their pigeons in and around
                            their 'girns.' (They had warned the village of their intention and
                            received no intimation that their arrival would be resented.) Reading
                            between the lines it is clear that the people of Danishwai had been
                            annoyed (!) by the shooting of their pigeons on a previous occasion.
                            They were therefore likely to be annoyed by this repetition of the
                            offense by the same offenders (!) It may perhaps therefore be admitted
                            that they prepared to act on the first movement of the offenders, but it
                            is impossible to admit the charge of evil premeditation on their part
                            considering that their action was to depend upon that of others upon
                            whom the real and sole responsibility should be laid.</p>
                        <p> "We may admit therefore that. </p>
                        <p>(1) The people failed to moderate their opposition to their aggressors
                            (Failed to moderate is an ingenious description of an assault of a most
                            cowardly and brutal character upon unresisting men.) </p>
                        <p>(2) They did not confine their action to preventing them continuing the
                            aggression. (Too true !) </p>
                        <p>(3) They were not content with taking their guns by way of indemnity.
                            (The guns were given them by Major Pine-Coffin's or lers). </p>
                        <p>"Moreover they are more to blame than their attenders because they did
                            not seek redress by legal means but defended their rights by a gross
                            aggression, which was all the grosser that he was made against officers
                            of the army of occupation. Armies of occupation have in all countries
                            rights based upon force and maintained by force only. The responsibility
                            of the people was increased by the death of one of the officers
                            happening a few hours after the incident and by two others being
                            dangerously wounded."</p>
                        <p>Our contemporary then criticizes the constitution of the Special Court,
                            which it asserts was not, required in this case. That is a matter of
                            opinion, and not of fact, and we shall therefore refrain from discussing
                            the question. The fact that a strong guard of troops was kept round or
                            near the courthouse is severely commented. In our opinion the presence
                            of the troops, so far from influencing the judges, as our contemporary,
                            oddly enough, suggests, was necessary to avoid the risk of the court
                            being, "influenced" by the hostile demonstrations of relatives of the
                            accused. Our contemporary continues by blaming the presence of the
                            British Advisors of the Ministries of the Interior and Finance at the
                            trial. They would have been blameworthy bad they lightly absented
                            themselves from what was, from the point of view of any high official, a
                            very important and interesting case. The advisers, we are assured, are
                            "representatives of the British Occupation". In what sense pray? Not
                            officially, for they rank as Egyptian officials just as the Armenian
                            Nubar Pasha or the Frenchman Suleiman Pasha. </p>
                        <p>Our contemporary next attacks Helbawi Bey, who, as an ex-Nationalist,
                            gets no quarter, and then makes certain remarks about the pigeons, which
                            it declares constitute real property, the shooting of which is
                            prohibited by English law as an act of theft. But the question arises
                            here a question which our contemporary does not attempt to solve whether
                            "beladi" pigeons can be said to be the property of any individual. Birds
                            that migrate as do the beladi pigeons from one district to another are
                            surely in no sense "domestic." "Al Moayad" also declares that Egyptian
                            law classes it among the offences that can be resisted by all possible
                            means. Does our contemporary affirm that if A. sees B. firing at pigeons
                            that he believes are his, he has a right to shoot B. or to attempt to
                            break his head with blows of a nabout? </p>
                        <p>Finally we have a prophetic but inaccurate description of the execution.
                            It is, to put matters plainly, a tissue of inaccuracies. We should like
                            to state that:</p>
                        <p> 1. That the men condemned to death were prevented from witnessing the
                            flogging of other prisoners, the doors to their tents being turned in
                            the opposite direction.</p>
                        <p> 2. That they were hanged in presence of their women and children when
                            all accounts concur in stating that the women and children, and indeed
                            all the inhabitants of Danishwai, were kept within the village at a
                            distance of some hundred yards. </p>
                        <p>We should also like to remind our contemporary that when Moslems of the
                            "varnished" class, the class which drinks cognac and haunts cafés, were
                            heard in Cairo on the night after the Denishwai affair became known,
                            drinking toasts in honour of the murderers of Capt. Bull, it was a
                            little unwise to assume, as our contemporary has done, that the whole
                            population of Egypt disapproved most heartily of the attack, etc., etc.,
                            and regarded the whole affair as a sad misunderstanding. In response to
                            numerous applications for the issues of the "Egyptian Gazette"
                            containing the report of the Denishwai trial, we may state that these
                            issues are now out of print. </p>

                    <head>ATTACK ON BRITISH SOLDIER</head>
                    <p>An unpleasant incident is reported from the neighborhood of Mex, a British
                        soldier, Pte. O'Brien, of the 2nd Royal Dublin Fusiliers, having been
                        brutally assaulted while returning to camp at Dekhileh to the west of Mex. </p>
                    <p>At about midnight on Monday be was riding back to camp on a donkey and had
                        reached point near the station when he was attacked by three men who set
                        upon him and not finding any money (which the soldier carried in his boot)
                        beat him and kicked him in the abdomen in the most brutal fashion and then
                        made off, on hearing the approach of some persons. </p>
                    <p>The donkey boy of course took to his heels and the injured man made the best
                        of his way back to camp. He did not report the incident till next day, when
                        finding himself very weak and in great pain he demanded to be admitted to
                        hospital. </p>
                    <p>His injuries are severe, double hernia having been produced by the kicks he
                        received and will require at least three weeks' medical treatment. </p>
                    <p>The police have been successful in capturing two of the Arabs involved; the
                        arrest of the third will probably be announced in the course of the day. </p>
                    <p>We do not consider that this attack has any importance beyond that of any
                        other crime of violence. Soldiers returning to Mex camp have been more than
                        once robbed in the past, and in our opinion this long and rather lonely road
                        ought to be patrolled be two or three mounted policemen. </p>

                    <head>DREDGER FOR ALEXANDRIA</head>
                    <p>Messrs. Wa. Simons and Co. (Limited), of Renfrew, launched from their yard a few days ago, 
                        complete and ready for work, a powerful twin-screw stern-wheel 1000-ton hopper dredger which
                        they have constructed to order of the Egyptian Government for the improvement of the port of 
                        Alexandria. The bucket ladder, which is constructed of the best form of cinder work in 
                        accordance with the builders' latest practice, is designed for dredging to
                        A depth of 40 feet below water level. Owing to the varied nature of the material 
                        to be dredged at Alexandria, two sets of buckets are provided, one set of large cubic capacity
                        for raising free material and one set of smaller buckets of exceptional strength and special design
                        for rock dredging. The dredger is propelled at eight knots speed by two sets of compound surface
                        condensing engines, each driving its own propeller, steam being supplied by two steel multi-tubular
                        boilers constructed to Lloyd’s requirements for 120lb. working pressure. The dredger, which is named
                        the Cleopatra, has been built to the requirements of the British Admiralty under the direction of
                        Colonel Raban, Director of Works, Admiralty, assisted by Lieutenant John P. James and Engineer-Commander
                        W. D. Chop”, who have acted as resident Admiralty overseers over the boil, engines, and boilers respectively.

                    <p>The conferment of the Order of Marit upon the Barl of Cromer bas been cordially welcomed at home, and 
                        the Government are congratulated by the press generally for this prompt recognition of his further 
                        splendid services in Egypt.
                        The following are a few of the leading newspaper comments:
                    </p>
                    <div type="item">

                        <p>Perhaps the most unexpected" item in the list is that which heads it-the bestowal of the Order of Merit upon Lord Cromer.
                            There is nothing inappropriate in the selection, for there is no Order of any kind which Lord Cromor's name would not adorn. 
                            But the fact that the Order of Merit was understood to be confined to persons eminent in science, literature, or art, and to
                            those who had won distinction in the fighting services, is bound to excite some curiosity as to Lord Cromer's claim. It the 
                            Government wanted a technical defence, they might fairly say that in honouring Lord Cromer's great administrative services 
                            they were honouring an extraordinarily successful application of the scientific method to practical affairs; while have not
                            his annual reports been for years the most engrossing and widely-read pages in our official literature. The public will be 
                            agreed, however, that where it is a question of honouring Lord Cromer no excuses are necessary.</p>

                        <p>The highest honour in the gift of the King —that of the Order of Merit has been bestowed upon Lord Cromer. The greatest of all 
                            modern Empire builders, he stands as the one man, unstained by the smudge of-financial interests, or the taint of ambition and
                            notoriety bunting, who has ruled a dependency in wholehearted devotion to the welfare of the inhabitants.

                        <p> Lord Cromer's appointment to the Order of Merit is wholly felicitous, for no one has vindicated the governing talent of his 
                            countrymen to their greater honour, and his work in Egypt has long since raised itself above the level of controversy. Promotions
                            to the Order of Merit will always invite severe scrutiny, but Lord Cromer's place in the exclusive circle is beyond cavil.

                        <p> Lord Cromer enters the jealously guarded portals of the Order of Merit: there are few living Englishman who have deserved better
                            of their country, who we achieved more solid work, or who have sustained the national prestige at a higher pitch in the eyes of

                    <p>In the absence of Lord Hillingdon, the Earl of Bessborough presided over the annual meeting of the company of the above name at Winchester
                        House, London, last week. The accounts showed net profits of £464,200, and a dividend of 16s, per share, was agreed to. The Chairman said 
                        that the report would be regarded by the shareholders as quite satisfactory. From an agricultural point of view the year 1905 had been favorable. 
                        Certain lines of railway had seen their receipts augmented, and the total of the kilometrical guarantees paid by the Government was diminished 
                        by £T.57,448. He was pleased to state that their relations with the Imperial Government continued satisfactory. The arrangement for the service 
                        of the Macedonian treasury, commenced in March 1905, centralized in the hands of the bank the responsibilities of the three vilayets. Their 
                        activity in the provinces had had during the year 1905 a very considerable enlargement arising not only from the creation of several sub-agencies 
                        but also from the marked development in the position of these agencies. The deposits of the public continued to show a considerable increase,
                        notwithstanding the competition of new banks, which were allowing higher rates of interest than theirs. - The report was adopted, and a statutory
                        resolution was carried prolonging the existence of the company.

                        financial position stronger than the most sanguine could have anticipated.
                        The steady flow of prosperity which has marked Egypt for some years has
                        continued with increased force, and no doubt can be entertained that
                        additional hotel accommodation will be required. You will see that steps
                        have been taken to provide this in order to retain our hold on the visitors
                        to Cairo. The construction of the Assouan dam has contributed to an increase
                        in the value of agricultural land, while the British capital freely invested
                        in this, and industrial and other ventures, is an evidence that the British
                        occupation will be permanent. The knowledge of this has produced a sense of
                        security hitherto unknown in Egypt and has given a stimulus to trade and the
                        investment of capital by Europeans, as well as by native landowners, whose
                        wealth had been previously, hoarded up to avoid the consequences apprehended
                        from the uncertain political conditions formerly existing. Their economic
                        changes have affected both the takings of our hotels and the value of our
                        property. </p>

                    <head>SALES OF SURPLUS LAND</head>
                    <p> Our land at Ghezireh has risen enormously in value, and, as indicated in the
                        director’s report, we have sold our surplus land at Ghezireh at a price far 
                        greater than we over expected, which, we hope, will enable us within a comparatively
                        short period to pay off our debentures. The service of the debentures at present
                        costs £13,305 per annum, by which amount the shareholders will benefit when all 
                        the debentures are paid off. In this connection, I might mention that in the early
                        stages of this rise in the value of land the Board gave Mr. Baehler, their general
                        manager, an option for the sale of all the surplus land at Ghezireb at a price that
                        would have realized about £100,000. Subsequently, however, Mr. Baehler voluntarily
                        surrendered this option and sold the land for the benefit of the company for £220,00. 
                        For this gratifying result we owe our best thanks to Mr. Baebler, and a resolution 
                        to record our appreciation of his services will be proposed for your consideration. 
                        Of the proceeds of the sale of this surplus land referred to above we have still to 
                        receive £120,000, payable within 10 years. The receipt of this sum will reduce the 
                        book value of our freehold and leasehold land and buildings to under £100,000, while 
                        the actual value of about 63.000 metres of land retained for hotel purposes at Ghezireh 
                        is largely in excess of that figure, without taking our hotel buildings at Ghezireh and 
                        at Shepheard's into account at all. The profits for the year amount to £45,158 108 7d, 
                        and are supplemented by interest and transfer fees, which bring up the total credit to 
                        profit and loss account for the year to £46,530 0s. 10d, as compared with £10,088 17s 8d 
                        for the preceding year. From this sum has to be deducted the service of the debentures, 
                        amounting to £13,305 10s 10d, while the other financial charges, including £3,571 for 
                        the amortisation of the compensation paid to the Cie. Internationale des Grands Hotels,
                        amount altogether to £4,131 9s 1d, making together £19,436 19s 11d, and leaving and net 
                        profit of £27,093 0s 11d, being £5,892 12s 11d more than last year. After three more years
                        the charge of £2,571 per annum completely amortise the compensation referred to and relieve 
                        the charge to profit and loss account to a corresponding extent.

                    <head>THE BALANCE SHEET</head>
                    <p>With regard to the balance sheet, I have already incidentally remarked on the
                        account headed "freehold and leasehold land and buildings." The plant,
                        fixtures and furniture have been added to by £2,647 6s, while very
                        considerable sums have been spent on maintenance, amply sufficient to cover
                        all depreciation. The item "goodwill" is gradually being reduced, a further
                        sum of £732 being written off last year. The goodwill at the formation of
                        the company represented the difference between the purchase price of the
                        various properties and the valuation of the assets taken over by the
                        company. The remaining assets call for no further comment beyond remarking
                        that the cash balance of £118,967 2s 11d is larger than at any time in the
                        history of the company. As regards the liabilities, the first mortgage
                        debenture debt has been reduced during the year by £48,600, while the second
                        debentures have been reduced by £100. Our general manager, Mr. Baebler,
                        reports that the hotels have been maintained in good state of repair and
                        efficiency out of revenue. The Board recognize and desire to express their
                        appreciation of the valuable services of Mr. Baehler, to whose good
                        management and foresight the present position of the company is largely due.
                        They also heartily acknowledge the assistance of the resident directors in
                        Cairo. I now beg to move ‘That the directors' report and accounts for the
                        year ending 30th April 1906, as submitted to the shareholders, be received
                        and adopted." </p>

                        sale thereof for the benefit of the company."</p>

                    <head>TURKISH COAL</head>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."
                        Sir, I have read your yesterday's article under the above heading with interest and its allusion to the 
                        cheapness of the Asia Minor coal bus suggested to my mind whether this coal could not be exported to Alexandria,
                        Port Said, and other Egyptian ports of bunker for ocean-going steamers. Would it not be cheaper and quicker to
                        get part of our supplies from Turkey than from Newcastle or Cardiff. The pit's mouth price of the Zonguldagh 
                        coal is, I believe, about 10s. and the situation of the mines almost on the sea is of immense advantage.
                        Of course, the coal cannot compete with Newcastle as regards quality, bat they mix very well. To, Heracles 
                        coalfield is of historic interest for it supplied all the British steamers engaged on the Crimean War, and 
                        the old locomotives and plant employed by the British are interesting relics of that time.
                        The coal is not very popular with a certain section of the Levantine shipping community who have contracts
                        with English collieries, but their objection is only natural. This notwithstanding there is no reason why the
                        coal ould not be introduced and tried in Egypt I am of the opinion that it wald pay. Yours, etc.,
                        SHIPPING AGENT.
