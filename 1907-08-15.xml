                <head>CROMER AND GORST.</head>
                <p>We extract the following from the "New York Times." After the "Maker of Egypt"
                    retired from the work to which he bad devoted half a lifetime, financiers began
                    to wonder whether after all Egypt's prosperity was a stable thing. Certainly the
                    change from poverty to affluence had been wrought with a rapidity entirely
                    without precedent. And the world is slow to believe that a country whose
                    Government was so recently bankrupt, and whose maladministration was a byword
                    among nations, should so dramatically blossom forth as a well-ordered,
                    law-abiding, and thoroughly solvent State. </p>
                <p>Today Egypt's population is double that of the time of the Pharaohs, and more
                    than five times more numerous than when the country was directly under Turkish
                    control. The ancient State has indeed been regenerated, and the vast Nile flood
                    controlled for irrigation purposes at a cost of hundreds of millions of
                    dollars.</p>
                <p> All this is directly due to Earl Cromer, who recently handed over the reins to
                    young Sir Eldon Gorst. All the world knows Cromer as the man of the iron hand
                    and the velvet glove: an administrative Bismarck, who found Egypt in a welter
                    and chaos of slavery, tyranny, and bankruptcy, and left it one of the freest,
                    richest, and most flourishing nations in the world.</p>
                <p> As Sir Evelyn Baring, Cromer earned the reputation of being a "hard" man. "Sir
                    OverBearing," they called him in Cairo. His successor is no stranger in the
                    land. Sir Eldon Gorst served his apprenticeship at Great Bri tain's Cairo
                    Agency, and in 1890 was appoint Ted Director of Taxes to the Egyptian
                    Government. He was successively Financial Under Secretary of State, Adviser to
                    the Minister of the Interior, and Financial Adviser to the Government.</p>
                <p> He has always been an intimate personal friend of Lord Cromer, to whom he owes
                    his rapid and successful career. In personal appearance Sir Eldon is much less
                    impressive than his famous predecessor, being short, slight, and fair, with
                    eyeglasses, that give him a professional appearance.</p>
                <p> He married two or three years ago Miss Evelyn Rudd, the daughter of a South
                    African millionaire. Lady Gorst is a very charming and tactful woman, and a very
                    great heiress besides. This is no slight advantage in the position she and Sir
                    Eldon are called upon to occupy inCairo, whose cosmopolitan society entertains
                    on a very lavish scale.</p>
                <p> Of course, Sir Eldon Gorst will continue directly Cromer's own traditions ; and
                    never more will Egypt hark back to the iniquitous era of the Khedive- Ismail,
                    whose personal extravagance increased the national debt from $50,000,000 to well
                    over $500,000,000. Ismail was, indeed, one of the most magnificent spendthrifts
                    that ever lived. One strategie move with the great Paris bank, the Société
                    Générale, procured him $60,000,000.</p>
                <p> And when the Franco-German war closed the Paris money market to him, he passed a
                    law known as the Makabale, in virtue of which taxpayers who came forward with
                    six years of taxes in advance could claim an exemption of half-taxes for the
                    rest of their lives. This expedient brought the lavish Khedive another
                    $25,000,000. He issued later on a loan of 9160,000,000 in London and Paris at a
                    preposterously high rate of interest, so that Egyptian bonds fell to less than a
                    quarter of their par value. Ismail could no longer raise money, and so he sold
                    176,000 shares of the Suez Canal Company to the British Government for a further
                    $20,000,000.</p>
                <p> It is no wonder that Egypt's finances were hopelessly involved and the peasantry
                    starving. Out of this welter Earl Cromer drew Egypt, aided by his lieutenant,
                    Sir Eldon Gorst, who is now in supreme control.</p>
                <p> There is at present but one peril, and this lies in the fact that the country
                    depends too exclusively on its cotton crop, which is worth $40,000,000 a year.
                    For this reason Sir Eldon Gorst is giving great attention to sugar-growing
                    experiments and cereals. Even the once despised Soudan is now being developed in
                    a marvellous way, especially by means of artesian wells. Then, too, the
                    Suakin-Berber Railroad is being laid by the Nubians of the Nile Valley at a cost
                    of $10,000,000, which money is being provided out of the surplus revenues of
                    Egypt.</p>
                <p>Agricultural land values have risen enormously. Fifty years ago good land could
                    be picked up at anything from $25 to $75 an acre, whereas to-day from $125 to
                    $200 is asked and cheerfully paid, in view of the great Government schemes
                    connected with the Blue and White Niles. A gigantic scheme has been devised to
                    convert many of the scorching wastes of the Nile Valley into rich plantations.
                    This is the design of Sir Eldon Gorst's chief wizard, Sir William Garstin. G. C.
                    M. G. Its cost is estimated at $170,000,000, and the period required for its
                    completion is about fifteen years.</p>
                <p> The scheme consists of ten sections, and is designed to benefit the Sudan as
                    well as Egypt proper. To begin with, the outflow of the infant Nile from the
                    Victoria and Albert Lakes is to be regulated; and later on in its course the
                    "River of Egypt" is to be provided with a new channel, so as to escape the vast
                    marshes of the Sou dan, where at present fifty per cent of the river flow is
                    wasted.</p>
                <p> One part of the scheme, if successful, will turn 750,000 acres into a garden
                    capable of turning in a revenue worth over six million dollars a year. When all
                    this is done, a new Egypt will arise, a thousandfold more fruitful than the old
                    one. </p>

                    <p> At 4.30 a.m. yesterday morning a fierce fire broke out in the Ater el Neby,
                        Old Cairo district, where a large store of dry durra and tibn was almost
                        completely destroyed. When the fire brigade arrived on the scene, the
                        conflagration was at its height and the surrounding buildings were
                        threatened. Although there was no water available for the steamers, the
                        brigade did brilliant work with 2 manuals and eventually succeeded in
                        getting the fire in check, after some 6 hours hard work, but not before
                        damage had been done to the extent of £120. Another fire occurred at 6.30

                        is believed that the cause of the fire is due to a flue setting light to a
                        wooden beam in a bakery on the ground floor. Two whole storeys were badly

                    <p> Kafr-el-Zayat has been disturbed by a terrible love, tragedy. M. Giovanni
                        Pintor, an agent of the Sabatelli works had fallen in love with a young
                        Italian girl of high family. His advances were favourably received, but for.
                        some reasons be was gradually snubbed and at length forbidden the house. He
                        threatened to kill himself, his sweetheart, and all connected with her, but
                        his threats were treated with disdain. However he presented himself at the
                        house one evening in company with some Arabs, and endeavoured to effect an
                        entrance. Pailing in this, he turned his revolver on himself. Three times he
                        pulled the trigger and each time it missed fire. At length he shot himself
                        in the lungs, and fell but without losing consciousness. The Arabs
                        accompanying him carried the wounded man to his house, from where he was
                        taken to the Tantah hospital. His condition is most serious, but it is hoped
                        that his constitution will pull him through.</p>

                <byline>NEW CAIRO BARRACKS.</byline>
                <p>In the House of Commons last week Mr. J. Robertson asked the Secretary of State
                    for Foreign Affairs whether the cost of the new barracks to be erected for the
                    army of occupation at Cairo is to be shared between the British and Egyptian
                    Governments; and, in that case, in whom the ownership of the barracks will vest.
                    Sir E. Grey.--The answer to the first part of the hon. member's question is in
                    the negative. The existing barracks are Egyptian Government property (except a
                    small part built by British War Office funds), and are held by the army of
                    occupation so long as required for military purposes. The new barracks will also
                    be the property of the Egyptian Government, and held on the same terms. </p>

                        in May last as voted by the Egyptian Ministry of Finances to meet the costs
                        of movements of troops of the army of occupation in 1906, was in addition to
                        the sum of £200,000 agreed upon to be paid by the Egyptian Government
                        towards the costs of the army of occupation and in addition to the sum
                        recently voted for the construction of new barracks at Cairo for the army of
                        ocenpation, Sir E. Grey.-- I have no information as to the £200,000 referred
                        to in the question. The sum payable by the Egyptian Governmemt to meet the
                        extra cost of maintaining the British forces in Egypt since April 1 last is
                        £150,000 a year. Prior to that date it was £100,000 a a year. In addition to
                        the £100,000 paid for the financial year 1906-07, a sum of £52,000 was paid
                        in respect of the increase of troops in 1906. The arrangements as to the

                    <p>The above case was resumed before the Bel gian Consulate at 9 a m. yesterday
                        morning. The court was presided over by M. Georges Eid, consul. The accused,
                        Vittorine Heureux, was brought into the room at 9.30 accompanied by a prison
                        official. M. Kassab, chancellor of the consulate, read the report of Dr.
                        Warnock who examined the prisoner. The doctor declared that Vittorine is a
                        normal person, subject to epileptie fits. She has an irritable nervous
                        system and her mind is of an excitable and hysterical nature. She is not
                        altogether responsible for her actions. During the reading of this report
                        Vittorine Heureux was suddenly taken ill, and carried out. She was heard to

                        certain Oppenheim from whom she had a child, and when deserted by Oppenheim,
                        he offered to keep her, to which she agreed. But after three months he found
                        it impossible to continue to live with her, and decided to effect a
                        severance. This was done, though the woman threatened to set fire to his
                        house if he did not marry her. Many scenes resulted and on one occasion he
                        struck her across the back with his stick. The accused was sentenced to four

                    <p>Sir, I have no difficulty to answer your question as to where did I take the
                        plate Bloc de grès à Cardium edule, L," which figures in front of my
                        "Contribution à l'étude des environs de Marsa Matrouh” (Alexandria 1907).
                        The plate has been very courteously lent to me by Rev. Karl Maria Kaufman,
                        the distinguished German archaeologist, and represents a block found by him
                        while unearthing the Menas City in Mariout, from among the ruins. My
                        original idea was to insert it among other illustrations in the text, but

                        fourth part of his valuable reports, this first idea was abandoned in order
                        to reserve an amount of original material of notes and illustrations for the
                        said report. It was only at the last moment, while the entire composition of
                        my work was in the press, that I thought it better to replace, by Mr.
                        Kaufman's plate, a geometrical figure of Arabic style which my editor had
                        placed to fill up a waste space in the title page. It is why no mention,
                        could be made in the text at the time. I am very glad, however, that you
                        gave me thus the occasion to publicly thank my friend, the Rev. Carl. Maria
                        Kaufman, for his above-mentioned courtesy I am, Sir, ete. D. E. PACHUNDAKI.

                <head>THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. MANCHESTER TRADE DIFFICULTIES</head>
                <p>As briefly reported in our cable of the 8th inst, a meeting of the creditors of
                    Hamaui Brothers and Co., of Manchester, and Hamaui and Sons, of Cairo, merchants
                    and shippers, was held at Manchester on Wednesday last. The statement of affairs
                    showed liabilities amounting to £31,689, and assets of £55,520 in connexion with
                    the Cairo-house. There was also a liability in respect of bills of exchange
                    accepted by Hamaui Brothers and Co., in case such bills are not provided for by
                    the drawers, who are under obligations to do so, of £82,434, and a liability on
                    bills discounted, on which it is probable claims will arise, of £27,400. The
                    meeting was adjourned so that the Egyptian creditors might have an opportunity
                    of considering a proposal that they should agree to accept six half-yearly
                    payments in fall without interest. The Manchester firm will pay twelve quarterly
                    instalments without interest is this proposal is accepted, and the business will
                    be carried on under three inspectors. A statement of the affairs of Messrs. A
                    Siso and Co., of Manchester, and Messrs. Siso, Lion, and Co., of Cairo and
                    Alexandria, was last Thursday submitted to the creditors of the two firms. It
                    was shown that the liabilities of the Manchester house were £55,604, and assets
                    £7,243. The accounts of the Cairo house show a sum due to trade creditors of
                    £8,750, making the total liabilities £64,354. In connexion with the Cairo house
                    there is a liability on bankers' and merchants' bills discounted of £37,954, and
                    on these claims may arise. The assets of, the Egyptian firm are set down at
                    £84,439, making the total assets £91,682, and, as in the case of the two firms
                    who have had to I place their affairs before their creditors, the meeting
                    resolved that, with a view to enabling the firms to pay their debts in full
                    Messrs. A. Siso and Co. should be allowed to continue their business under deed
                    of inspectorship. Another Manchester firm in the Egyptian trade, Messrs.
                    Picciotto, Shalom, and Co., of South Parade Manchester, has issued circulars
                    calling a meeting of its creditors for Monday 12th. inst. Business with Egypt is
                    for the moment practically at a standstill, so far as Manchester firms are
                    concerned. </p>

                <head>PROSPECTS OF THE CROP.</head>
                <p> An Alexandria correspondent writing on July 29 to the "Manchester Guardian" says
                    that the interest of the week has been centred less in public dealings on the
                    cotton market than in the current of private transactions between various
                    Egyptian houses for the adjustment of their positions. To this more than to
                    market barterings may be attributed the rise with which the week closes. In all
                    likelihood this upward movement, in spite of the general stagnation of business,
                    will continue for a time. It is known that the oversold positions are not all
                    covered yet. When covered the market, is wondering how the height, conquered at
                    so heavy a loss on sellers, will be maintained. For one thing, it is reported
                    that trades in the happy situation of being in funds are buying in the interior
                    at parities of 175 and 18, which cultivators are said to be accepting. Secondly,
                    the restriction of credit is a necessity to which the inflexibility of the banks
                    is subjecting the market as intensely as before, if not more so. The condition
                    of the Nile flood, continues the correspondent, is engaging attention. A report
                    just issued shows in a favourable light the prospects of the flood and of the
                    cotton crop. A one metre rise has within the past week occurred in the Atbara
                    river. The Nile flood proper appears late in rising this year. The occasional
                    fluxes in its volume have not raised levels to the general average of the
                    period. This slight backwardness will not, however, adversely affect the cotton
                    crop, which is assured of plentiful irrigation by supplies released from the
                    Assuan dam. The decisive index of the flood is the state of the Blue Nile, more
                    particularly in the early part of August. Last year's flood presented many
                    points of similarity to this year's up to the stage we have now reached. As in
                    the present season, the flood in 1906 was below the average until August, after
                    which it improved rapidly. The rise that then set in proceeded from a marked
                    increase in the Atbara at the end of July. As the elevation now recorded in the
                    Atbara appears likely to be sustained, there is every probability that the flood
                    will run much the same course and attain much the same height as last year's,
                    which was eminently satisfactory. </p>

                <byline>METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS.</byline>
                <p> PROSPECTS OF NILE FLOOD.</p>
                <p> The following notes on the meteorological conditions of the season and the
                    prospects of the Nile flood have been issued by Captain Lyons, Director of the
                    Survey Department :</p>
                <p> The months of July, and August are those in which the Abyssinian rainfall is
                    heaviest and 30 per cent of the whole annual rainfall falls in each month. The
                    effect of this is to cause a rapid rise in the level of the Blue Nile in July,
                    while in August and the first ten days of September the river at Roseires
                    oscillates near its highest | level. The average rise in July at this station is
                    four metres, while in August an additional increase of 0.7 or 0-8 metres is
                    normally recorded. </p>
                <p> Up to the end of June, the prospects of the Nile Flood were unfavourable ; the
                    temporary relief caused by a Blue Nile flood wave in April affected the Nile in
                    Egypt in May but I passed away in the early part of June, and the small and
                    irregular flood waves of the first rise had small effect, being fed by a
                    rainfall which was weak all over Abyssinia and only 50 per cent of the normal
                    amount at Addis Abbaba. </p>
                <p> In July, the rains have been persistently weak and have been interrupted by
                    breaks of comparatively dry weather which severely | affected the rivers. Fair
                    rates of rise at the beginning and end of the month on the Blue Nile were
                    divided by a fortnight in which the river oscillated to and fro but did not rise
                    I effectively. The total rise in the month was 2.4 metres instead of 4.0 metres.
                    The Atbars also shewed the same period of interrupted rainfall.</p>
                <p> Throughout the month, atmospheric pressure over Egypt and Syria , was about 2
                    mm. in excess until the end of the month when it fell just below the normal, at
                    a time when an improvement was reported from the Arabian Sea and North Western
                    India. It cannot be said that any distinct sign of such an improvement has
                    appeared in the Abyssinian rains. The per ported rainfalls of the Abyssinian and
                    Sudan area for July are : </p>

                <p> Thus the rains have been exceptionally weak and shew but little improvement on
                    those of June. The stations are far too few to shew the distribution of the
                    rains, so the river. gange readings must be used to supplement them. Taking the
                    ganges furthest up-stream on the Atbars and the Blue Nile as most nearly
                    representing the rainfall, we have :-) </p>

                <p> thus the exceptional weakness of the rainfall must have extended to the whole of
                    the Abyesinian tableland. In August, when the Abyssinian rains are at their
                    maximum, our knowledge of the extent to which the meteorological conditions in
                    Egypt and the Sudan affect the rainfall is not yet sufficient advanced to be a
                    safe guide. For the present, therefore, it is only possible to examine records
                    of past years and to note that high atmospheric pressure in Egypt has almost
                    always been an unfavourable sign. Up to the present date we have, as already
                    mentioned, a large deficiency in the flood. </p>

                <p>Referring to the records of past years, in one alone--1903—-was there a
                    deficiency of a metre in the Wadi Halfa mean gauge readings of 1-5 August, which
                    was followed by levels</p>

                    <p>slightly above the average in September. Thus, the June rainfall, which is
                        estimated to provide 18 percent of the flood water, was fully 50 per cent
                        deficient; the July rainfall, estimated to provide 30 per cent, was about 30
                        per cent deficient, (Addis Abbaba-88%, Roseires25%); thus some 16 per cent
                        of an average flood volume may be considered as deficient up to the present
                        time. On the whole, it seems more probable that this deficiency will be
                        increased in August than that it will be diminished. If this should be the
                        case, the principal interest will lie in the occasional winter rainstorms
                        which may occur between November and March and which have, both in 1906 and
                        1907, greatly improved the low stage supply. </p>

                    <head>THE COMMONS' EGYPTIAN CIGARETTES</head>
                    <p> Some gentleman aflame with public zeal has, says the "Tribune” been writing
                        to the papers to complain that the Havana cigars sold at the Monse of
                        Commons are made in Guernsey, and that the Egyptian cigarettes are
                        manufactured in Whitechapel. There is a grain of truth in the assertion, but
                        like all partial truths, it is misleading. The House of Commons is a place
                        of varied tastes, and the Kitchen Committee cater for them all. A member of
                        Parliament may | buy a twopenny smoke of no known origin, or he may aspire
                        to a two shilling cigar imported direct from Havana. The Guernsey production
                        are plainly marked, with their place of, manufacture, and have a certain
                        popularity: 1t is the same with cigarettes. Some are made in London, some
                        are specially sent from Turkey. All that the caterers insist on is that the
                        place of origin I shall be marked. </p>

                <head>VENTILATION DES EGOUTS </head>
                <p>Sur l'avis conforme de la Délégation, le président a proposé de voter à cet effet
                    un crédit de LE. 3000, à prélever sur le crédit global de LE. 19000 que
                    nécessitera l'extension du système à toute la canalisation de la ville. Mansour
                    bey ayant fait observer qu'avant de voter cette dépense, qu'il trouve d'ailleurs
                    exagérée pour un essai, il y aurait lieu d'étudier avec soin si le système en
                    question répond aux exigences de l'hygiène, M. Ehrlieh lui a répondu que le
                    système n'était plus à l'état d'essai mais qu'il entrait définitivement dans la
                    période d'application après études préalables de l'ingénieur en chef et des
                    services compétents.</p>
                <p> Tout cela est bel et bon, mais la question est de savoir si les conseillers
                    municipaux doivent voter les crédits les yeux fermée ou s'ils ont le droit
                    d'exiger d'abord un rapport sur la question. C'est ce que demandait Mansour Bey.
                    On a voté le crédit quand même à la sollicitation de Schiess Pacha et le plus
                    curieux, c'est que Mansour Bey a fini par se rallier. Dans ces conditions nos
                    édiles ne sont plus que des machines à voter. </p>

                <head>ENCORE LES CREDITS </head>
                <p>Les seuls crédits qui aient été ajournés à la suite des observations de Mansour
                    Bey, sont | les suivants : 375 LE: pour la construction de latrines et cabinet
                    de toilette au jardin Nouzha et 2000 LE. pour l'irrigation du jardin. Mansour
                    Bey a eu pleinement raison de demander un devis estimatif de ces dépenses, avant
                    de les approuver. </p>
                <p>En ce qui concerne les LE. 6250 proposées I pour la route en corniche conduisant
                    au palais de Ras-el-Tin, la Commission attend une réponse à sa lettre
                    sollicitant du Gouvernement une contribution plus élevée de sa part que son
                    offre de L.E. 1000, et cela d'autant plus que le route projetée est appelée a
                    profiter d'Etat autant qu'à la Municipalité. On croit que le Ministère proposera
                    un compromis acceptable pour la Commission et dans ce cas une décision sera
                    prise à la prochaine séance. </p>
