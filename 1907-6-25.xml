                        for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr. Najem Houry
                        proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent
                        Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to
                        Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
                        Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                        Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                        begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                        Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                        scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                        in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <p>I hereby certify that I have taken samples of every vatting of <hi rend="bold"
                        >Mackie's White Horse Celler</hi> Blend of Scotch Whisky used in bottling
                        during the month of September, and the results of my analyses indicate that it
                        conforms to the standard for Pot Still Scotch Whisky set up in the London case.
                        I am also of opinion that it is an old Whisky of excellent quality and flavour,
                        which has been well matured in wood.</p>

                               <head>A TREMENDOUS WORLD PROBLEM.</head>
                                <p>A tremendous world problem has begun, and is continuing, of
                                    which none can foresee the one. This problem is being played out in the
                                    United States, in Canada, in Australia, in New Zealand, and in South
                                    Africa. At first sight it seems merely a question of colour and of
                                    racial prejudice. But at bottom it is more than that - it is an economic
                                    question of the first order.</p>
                               <cb n="6"/>
                                <p>"Ultimately this may prove to be the most tremendous
                                question upon which great masses of mankind have ever been divided,"
                                says the "Daily Telegraph," "but any attempt to settle it by arms,
                                whatever the immediate issue, would mean sooner or later a hundred
                                years' conflict ; and not for this generation only but | for many,
                                the world's hopes for peace would be ennk deeper than Prosperó
                                dropped his book."</p>
                                <p>"The real root of the trouble," thinks the "Times," "is
                                not in any issue of general policy, but is to be sought in the
                                friction arising from the economic competition in the same area of
                                races differing wholly in habits and standards of living, and
                                disinclined to amalgamate-a competition of whose difficulties we
                                have already seen something within the British Empire, and with
                                which we shall inevitably have to deal in the future. Of the
                                difficulty created by this problem soine permanent solution based on
                                equitable compromise will yet have to be found. Failing it, the
                                trouble that is now creating such anxiety to all lovers of peace and
                                civilisation will inevitably recur at a later period, and recur in a
                                far more serious form."</p>
                               <p>"The standard of life among the Australian and American
                                democracies," adds the "Telegraph”, “would be utterly undermined by
                                unrestricted Asiatic competition-nay, would be swamped if the vast
                                floods of Chinese humanity, for instance, were to burst through the
                                frail legislative dikes now holding them back from empty or
                                half-peopled regions under white control; and the unrestricted
                                ingress of labour from the Far East would be more insidiously and
                                totally destructive of white welfare than war itself. In one word,
                                this is not a color question; it is fundamentally an economic
                                question. We trust our allies will take it at that, and will realise
                                that the point of national honour has been accidentally caught op
                                with the problem, but is not permanently involved in it. It would be
                                as illogical to make war upon it as to make war against the McKinley
                                tariff. Goods and men alike are discriminated against for economic
                                reasons."</p>
                               <p>"Those who look forward to a conflict at some time or
                                other caused by the determination of the Japanese to press, and the
                                determination of the Anglo Saxon overseas, both in America and in
                                Australia and New Zealand, to resist, the claim of the Japanese to
                                enter and to help to develop territories bordering on the Pacific
                                which the white man considers reserved for his special occupation,
                                can, unfortunately, not be described as mere visionaries or
                                dreamers," says the Spectator." "The hard, practical facts of the
                                case are with the pessimists. We may sum up the situation, indeed,
                                by saying that though things at present are not nearly as bad as
                                'the man in the street supposes, the future outlook, though not
                                necessarily a near future, is probably a good deal worse than he
                                imagines."</p>
                               <p>So much for the general statement of the issues which
                                hang on this tremendous problem. The whole matter is forced on
                                public attention just now by the conflict in California between
                                Americans and Japanese. The international standing of Japan among
                                the nations seemed to have been established by sacrifices and
                                achievements as heroic, whether in peace or war, as ever were
                                credited to any country," says the "Telepraph." "She took her place
                                as a Great Power, a nation among her equals. Yet in California her
                                subjects admitted under treaty are misused as though they were
                                helots or pariahs. The United States Government acknowledges that
                                injustice has been committed, but is almost absolutely prevented, by
                                the limitations of the American Constitution, from giving effectual
                                redress. That is the deadlock which has been created, and the
                                situation is as difficult for statesmanship at Washington as it is
                                trying to the Government of Tokyo and exasperating to the national
                                sentiment of its subjects.</p>
                               <p>"A solution can only be reached by placing a very loose
                                interpretation upon the letter of the law, and allowing
                                unconventional and uncompromising common sense to form a substitute
                                for pedantry and parchment. The American case, and we shall
                                endeavour to put it as fairly as the Japanese, is much better in
                                reason than in logie. Whether from the social or the political point
                                of view, the problem for the United States is real and it is grave.
                                It is raised by the procedure of the Californian authorities,
                                whether municipal bodies or State legislature. At their instigation,
                                or through their supineness, the subjects of a great and friendly
                                Power, in peaceful exercise of their treaty rights, have been
                                harassed and humiliated. There has been an endeavour to exclude them
                                from American soil and to boycott them where they are settled upon
                                it. They have been ejected from the public schools and obstructed in
                                the pursuit of their business. There has been an attempt to place a
                                stigma of racial inferiority upon them." | With such issues pending,
                                the President has decided to dispatch the fleet to the Pacific and
                                he has taken this grave step because he is convinced that the risk
                                of aggravating the situation was better incurred than when the
                                remotest danger of leaving the Californian coast defenceless, in
                                case some unfortunate incident should precipitate a crisis.</p>

                    <p>The Mex fountain water supply was stopped the day before yesterday by the
                        fountain being broken during a quarrel among a party of women. A

                        express the hope that the company will realise the necessity of immediately
                        repairing the fountain and restoring the supply of water.</p>

                        piastres was stolen from one of them. Two young girls managed to run away
                        from the young hooligans, but the other three children all received wounds
                        of more or less dangerous nature. Two of the native boys were arrested and

                    <head>Fire in Alexandria,</head>
                    <p>A fire broke out in Alexandria yesterday evening about 8 o'clock in a
                        draper's shop of a small street of the Mohamed Ali midan, and was only
                        extinguished after more than a couple of hour's hard work by the fire
                        brigade. The interior of the shop and its contents were completely
                        destroyed, but the walls were left standing and the adjacent shops on either
                        side were only slightly charred in places. Judging from the reports which we
                        have received and from a visit to the scene of the fire the brigade must
                        have worked with great efficiency to have saved the shops on either side,
                        and confined 'the fire to the interior of the one building. It is said that
                        the damages amount to £12,000, and that the insurance only covers £8,000.
                        The shop was well stored with Manchester goods, the whole stock of which is
                        destroyed, but we would not be surprised to learn that their estimation at
                        £12,000 is somewhat exaggerated.</p>

                    <head> The Cairo Pollice.</head>
                    <p>So much has been said and written about the incompetency of our Cairo police
                        in the local papers, that it is quite a pleasure to be able to report a
                        really smart capture recently effected by the greatly maligned arm of the
                        law. Rizk Awad, a keeper of a "tarboucherie" in Sharia Clot bey, lodged a
                        complaint with the police at the end of last week, to the effect that Bank
                        notes worth L.E. 600, which he had been carrying about in one of his pockets
                        for some days, had disappeared, but he was unable to give any definite
                        information as to when or where he first became aware of the notes being
                        missing. He stated that he was of opinion that he had been robbed, although
                        he could not point out any particular suspect. On the other hand, it was
                        possible that he had simply lost them somewhere in the street. With very
                        little hope or chance of success the police took the matter in hand.
                        Yesterday an agent of police, named Amer Mahanni, while on duty observed a
                        native approach a European and offer three notes of L. E. 100 each for sale,
                        "and his suspicion being aroused, he took the native into custody, with the
                        unexpected result that the whole of the missing som was recovered. The
                        matter is not yet settled, however, as a discussion has arisen in regard to
                        the payment of 10% of the value of the lost property which the owner refuses
                        to make, and therefore, for the present, the money has been confiscated.</p>

                    <head>Prize Distribution</head>
                    <div type="item">
                        <p>On Tuesday afternoon the session of St. Andrew's Schools was brought to a close
                        by an exhibition of work, and distribution of prizes, in the
                            Boy's High School under the patronage of C. A. Greig Esq. H. B. M's Acting
                            Consul.Prior to the distribution of prizes a varied programme consisting of recitations and dialogues in English, French
                        and Arabic was given in a large tent erected for the
                            occasion-and large though it was it proved insufficient to contain the great assemblage of people, many of whom were unable to
                        obtain seats.This vast gathering bore ample-testimony to the popularity of the school, and an examination of the work on exhibition in
                        one of the large class rooms of the school furnished the secret of this deserved popularity.
                        This work comprised commercial book keeping in French among part
                            of and English, geography and maps, samples of essays and arithmetic in
                        English, and sheets of Arabic writing and translation : but without doubt the best pieces of work in the exhibition were two large
                            wall maps of Palestine, illustrating Old and New Testament times, which were drawn to perfection
                            by Apostolos Constantinides.The recitations and elocution were most creditable
                            and showed that in all three th Department, the languages taught, the pupils
                            receive a thorough training, - the only failing being that on account of the
                            performance being in the open and before such a vast assembly of people, the
                            performers, in order to be heard had to speak rather loudly, and their
                        bests could not be expected.</p>
                        <p>The second part of the programme consisted of an operatta entitled "Abou Hassan"
                        or “ The Baker's Dream," it was first occasion upon which such a thing has been
                        attempted, the performance was exceedingly good. The boys sang tunefully and
                        acted creditably, Master H. Taylor making an excellent "Baker" whilst the
                        "Caliph" was in the capable hands with Master Batey. The other principals were
                        also very good. The whole of the music, staging and scenery were directed by Mr.
                        O. Stanley Heaton who deserves great credit and praise for his hard work and
                        untiring energy in this branch of the work.</p>
                        <p>The prizes were distributed by Mr. C.A. Greig, the principal prize winners being
                        C. Mazarakis the dux of the school, and the two "Allan" Medallists, M. Oelbaum
                        from the High School, and D. Abramovitch of the Lower School. These medals-one
                        for each school-are presented annually by Major Allan,Glasgow, for Bible study,
                        and the proficiency in this subject could be gauged by an excellent essay on
                        "The Life and Character of Samson," written and exhibited by the medallist
                        Oelbaum.</p>
                        <p>After the distribution of the prizes Mr. C.A.said that from what was seen of work
                        inside and heard by all, they might rest assured that boys from St. Andrew's
                        School received a very thorough education and need not fear to go and take their
                        places in any department as quite the equals of boys from any other school, and that if any fault could be found it might be the danger to                        the staff and pupils of working too hard. He congratulated Mr. Buchanan and
                        his staff upon a very successful year's work and concluded by wishing all a very
                        pleasant holiday. After three cheers to Mr. Greig and a like compliment to Mr. Buchanan the
                        proceedings closed with"God Save the King.”</p>
                        <p>It was fitting that a new St. Andrew's flag with the School's initials, presented by Mrs Shorter should be floating
                        over the school for the first time.</p>

                   <head>MR. R.J. MOSS'S CIRCULAR.</head>
                   <p>The Nationalist Press is still making merry over the facts mentioned in the letter of Mr. Robert J. Moss, which appeared in our issue of the 8th inst. Mr. Moss therein stated that over one thousand circulars were issued by post or by hand addressed in accordance with the latest completed list obtainable from the British Consulate at Alexandria. Each circular contained a request that the recipient should give his opinion as to the form the testimonial to Lord Cromer should take, as it would be of assistance if the views of the British Colony could be ascertained before the matter was again brought before the general public. Of these one thousand circulars, 130 were returned through the dead letter office. Therefore of the thousand 870 were received by the members of the British Colony at Alexandria. As only 29 replies were sent back to Mr. Moss, no less than 841 of the persons, who received the circulars, were so indifferent to the question of a testimonial to Lord Cromer that they never took the trouble to answer. As Mr. Moss said, "Until more public interest has been taken in the matter it appears to me to be useless to publish any details." These facts are seized upon with avidity by the Nationalist newspapers and it is attempted to infer from the statements contained in Mr. R. J. Moss's letter that therefore the British Colony "hated the Cromerian Administration." The "Egyptian Standard” thus concludes an article on this subject:-</p>
                   <p>"Only a few Imperialists adoring it (i e. Lord Cromer's administration) 29 all told."</p>
                   <p>"And, in order to enable the British nation to bow down and worship these Imperialist financiers, capitalists and stockbrokers, it has to vote a grant of £50,000 to the man whose administration was unis versally 'hated."</p>
                   <p> It is needless to point out that this deduction from Mr. Moss's words is nonsense. Because only 29 members of the British Colony at Alexandria, out of 870 who receive a circular, took the trouble to reply, it is obvious that to infer that therefore those who failed to reply, hated his Lordship's administration, is quite beside the facts of the case. The real explanation for this indifference is that to most persons here Lord Cromer was only a name. Whenever he was obliged to come to Alexandria to see the Khedive, he used to hurry back to Cairo by the afternoon express. He never made prolonged visits to this city, for which he appeared to have no great affection. Furthermore, it is not surprising it the circular met with such small response, for in such a lethargic and indifferent atmosphere it is impossible to evoke enthusiasm about anything. We do not doubt, however, that when the memorial is finally decided upon, and the various factions claiming preference satisfied, the appeal for subscriptions will be as heartily answered by the British colony of Alexandria as by any.</p>

                   <head>THE VIVANTE AFFAIR.</head>
                   <head> AN ERRONEOUS REPORT.</head>
                   <p>A serious mistake has been made by the "Egyptian Standard” in reporting the Vivante affair. Our contemporary says:</p>
                   <p>"Writing on July 22nd our Alexandria correspondent adds a further item to the growing literature on the Vivante affair. People are apparently astonished at the news that Vivante on entering the hotel was accompanied by a lady friend who is well known in Alexandria as a person of high reputation, and who happened to stop in the same hotel. She remained it seems some time in Vivante's room, and there information ceases.</p>
                   <p>“The accounts of this fact contain agly insinuations. Does it follow that because this lady was the last person known to speak with Vivante before the crime she is accordingly the author of it</p>
                   <p>"We must await events, simply recording for the present that the lady enjoys an excellent and honorable reputation, is well connected, and is above suspicion."</p>
                   <p> Those who have followed our accounts of the affair will recognise that the paragraph is absolutely unwarranted and must be categorically denied. There have never been the slightest grounds for asserting that Vivante was accompanied by a lady, and we can only regret that such an untrue statement should have been made.</p>
                   <p>From enquiries made at the Greek Consulate we learn that the effects of Vivante which were examined there consisted merely of a few pieces of linen and some commercial letters, none of which afforded the slightest clue or had any bearing on the crime. Meanwhile the hands of the Greek Consular authorities are tied, and, though doing their best to assist the police, they can give no material aid until the latter have established the identăty of the assassin, when, in the event of his proving to be a Greek subject, they will conduct the case.</p>
                   <p>In the meanwhile we might repeat that it has been definitely concluded that Vivante was murdered and that the idea of suicide cannot for one moment be entertained.</p>
                   <p>Dr. Ralli, physician to the Greek Hospital, has given it as his opinion that the murder was committed by one man by means of the coup du Pore François, as theorised by us in a recent issue.</p>

                   <head>THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICE.</head>
                   <p>Sedky Bey, the General Secretary of the Alexandria Municipality, has compiled a report on the working of the administrative service during the past year, from which we extract the following facts.</p>
                   <p>During the legal year, 1905-1906 judgment was given in thirty cases in which the Municipality was a party. Twenty three of these cases were decided in favour of the Municipality. The amount paid for expropriating property was L.E. 10,500. The encashments for sales of land and tanzim surpluses came to about L.E. 20,000.</p> 
                   <p>There were 2,258 cases for the illegal occupation of the public ways. Out of this total there were only a hundred acquittals. There were 27 actions against chemists and 175 seizures of dogs.</p>
                   <p>The Tanzim drew up 115 misdemeanour cases and 806 unhealthy establishments were proceeded against</p>
                   <p>The way in which the footpaths in Alex-andria are unwarrantably occupied as though they belonged to the shopkeepers is a public nuisance of considerable magnitude. Sedky Bey remarks on this subject :-</p>
                   <p>Une réforme qui a été obtenue grâce aux de marches pressantes de la Municipalité, est celle de l'exécution en matière d'occupation indue de la voie publique. Précédemment, l'exécution d'un jugement ordonnant la cessation de l'état de contravention n'était qu'un simulacre ; le contrevenant ne tardait pas à occuper à nouveau la voie publique, et il fallait de nouvelles poursuites pour le contraindre à déguerpir, et ainsi de suite. Cette situation devenait intolérable et le respect même attaché aux jugements en était compromis. Le Ministère de la Justice, après examen de la question, a prescrit l'inntilité des poursuites nouvelles, lorsqu'on premier juge ment était intervenu et a autorisé la Police employer, an besoin, la force publique pour débarrasser la voie publique des occupations abusives. Les bienfaits de cette mesure commencent à se faire sentir, et ils seraient certainement plus évidents si la Police pou vait prêter son concours d'une façon plus constante.</p>
                   <p>No less than 308 proces-verbaux were drawn up against natives for non-vaccination. Not a single European, however, was proceeded against, because as Europeans are not obliged to register births it is therefore impossible to discover if their children are regularly vaccinated. This is a very unfortunate state of affairs and the ravages which small-pox has recently made among the European population of Alexandria may be considered as a set-off against the privileges of the Capitulations.</p>
                   <p>The correspondence of the Municipality has increased enormously of late years. Last year 4,730 European and 20,782 vernacular letters were received and 5,777 European and 17,600 vernacular letters despatched.</p>
                   <p>Last year the Municipal regular employee included 291 officials, 18 engineers, 18 doctors and 22 apprentices.</p>

                <head>EGYPT IN PARLIAMENT.</head>
                <head>THE CENSUS.</head>
                <p>Mr. John Robertson asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether the recent Egyptian census has been found to be imperfectly taken ; whether, in consequence, it is proposed to take a fresh census ; and, if so, when.</p>
                <p>Sir E. Grey.--I understand that the final figures of the recent census have not yet been issued.</p>
                <p>Mr. Robertson asked further whether the right hon. gentleman could state if it were the fact, as stated in the pro-Government Press of Egypt, that the census is grossly defective.</p>
                <p>Sir E. Grey.-My information is simply that the final figures are not yet published.</p>
                <p>THE LAMBERT AFFAIR.</p>
                <p>Dr. Rutherford asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he is aware that M. Lambert, a Frenchman, resigned the directorship of the Khedivial School of Law through differences with Mr. Dunlop, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Public Instruction, Egypt; whether he will explain the reason for the appointment of an Englishman to a Government post invariably held, since the establishment of the School of Law, by subjects of the French Republic, in view of the spirit of Article V. of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1904 ; and whether Mr. Dunlop will be requested to resign.</p>
                <p>Sir E. Grey.--I understand that Mr. Lam. bert, whose resignation was not desired, resigned his post as Principal of the Khedivial School of Law in consequence of a misunderstanding with the Ministry of Public Instruction on the subject of his leave. In view of the growing demand t) enter the English side of the School the Egyptian Government decided to promote one of the existing English Professors to the vacanoy thus created ; there is no ground for the suggestion that such an appointment is in any way contrary to the spirit of the Anglo-French Agreement of 1904 and no reason whatever tor the reflection upon Mr. Dunlop contained in the question.</p>
                <p>Mr. Robertson asked whether it is the fact that Mr. Hill in his new post will have to give legal instruction in French and whether his qualifications for giving such instruction are very imperfect.</p>
                <p>Sir E. Grey answered that the authorities had fully taken into account the qualifications of the gentlemen available for the position, and were fully satisfied that the best possible choice had been made.</p>
                <p>The "Temps" in its evening's issne of the 18th inst. refers to Sir Edward Grey's declaration in the House of Commons respecting the Lambert case, and declares that he avoids the real issue, which is that the Anglo-Rgyptian Administration has persistently run counter to the friendly guarantee of French educational interests which was stipulated for in 1904. The French organ asserts that a roundabout policy of repression and discouragement towards the Khedivial School of Law and French instruction generally has always formed part of the programme of Lord Cromer and his subordinates. It proceeds to give a list of the cases where it alleges that young Englishmen of insufficient experience have been promoted to various posts, where French candidates who possessed better claims and qualifications had been passed over.</p>
                <p>While allowing the French schools every nominal liberty, in conformity with the 1904 Agreement, the Cromer policy has made plain to the parents of children attending them that their only chance of a career under Government service lies in future through the British Schools.</p>
                <p>The "Temps” observes: "The teaching of French in Egypt is not merely a moral force to which we hold, but it is also an instrument of economic force which we cannot renounce. 1 If French loses ground we shall see our commercial statistics dwindle with the number of those who read our books, newspapers, catalogues, and prospectuses. And our commerce is worth defending. To resume our engagement of 1904 is limited to the abandonment of all anti-British political action in Egypt. That engagement we have kept, and shall keep scrupulously; but on economic grounds and on intellectual grounds we have agreed to no renunciation, and shall consent to none."</p>

                   <head>AN EGYPTIAN FIND.</head>
                   <head>SAYINGS OF CHRIST.</head>
                   <p>The latest of the many discoveries by archeologists in Egypt
                            occurred some months ago at Edfou, in Upper Egypt, near the site of an
                            old Coptio monastery. A native, clearing his ground of stones,
                            accidentally laid bare a stall tomblike receptacle.</p>
                   <p>In this he found a number of parchment M88., bound in thick
                            papyrus covers. He sold them to an Arab dealer for a few pounds, and the
                            Arab in turn 'sold them to a Copt for £500.</p>
                   <p> The news had by this time gone abroad, and the representatives of the foreign museums made energetic efforts to acquire
                            the M88. The good fortune of securing them fell to Mr. de Rustafjaell,
                            F.R.G.S., the well-known tavol ler and explorer, and he sent them to
                            England, since when a great foreign university has tried to obtain
                            them.</p>
                   <p>The MSS. had already been identified as a unique Coptic and
                            Greek ecclesiastical M88. of the ninth to the eleventh centuries, of
                            great archeological importance, and about a dozen rolls of sixth-century
                            papyri. Among them  are twenty-five leaves of apocryphal sayings
                            of Christ, in a Coptic translation of a lost Grook original, of
                            which previously only thirteen leaves were known, twelve in the National
                            Gallery at Paris, and one at Berlin.</p>
                   
                   <p>The discovery also comprised parts of the Gospels of St.
                            Matthew, Bt. Mark and St. Luke in Greek and Coptic, the Apocalypse of
                            St. John, in Coptic ; the history of the Miracles by Cosmos and
                            Damien (dated sixth century); a sermon by St. Pisenthios in Coptio (this
                            copy is unique) ; a sermon by St. Cyril, (A.D. 851-886) on the
                            Sacred Cross, in Coptio, from an existing Greek original (this is the
                            only complete edition), and a unique MS. in the Nabian language dealing
                            with the life of St. Menos and the canons of the Nicacean council.</p>

                   <head>A UNIQUE LANGUAGE </head>
                   <p> Only fragments of MSS. in the Nubian language have been discovered hitherto. There are very few
                            scholars in the language and scarcely any published literature. Hence
                            the present volume, which is in an excellent state of
                            preservation, is of first rate importance.</p>
                   <p>From a dedication in one of the M88. the monastery on the
                            site of which they were discovered, is proved to have been named " St.
                            Mercury of the Mount at Edfo," and one of the volumes is a history of
                            the Martyrdoh of St. Mercurios.</p>
                   <p>A modern Coptic monastery stands near e the site, but the
                            name of the older founda- tion had been entirely lost until this
                            discoyery.</p>
                   <p> Egypt has also yielded another " find to Mr. de Rustafjaell's researobes. In the Desert of the Nile
                            he found, among the remains the Paleolithic flint factories, a number
                            crude and weather beaten limestone was resembling troughs and pots like
                            ironstone concretions. He holds them to be of Palæolithic age. They are
                            certainly older the the Neolithic age, which covered a considerable
                            period in Egypt before the advent of the First Dynasty in B.C.
                            4440.</p>
                    <p> Mr. de Rustafjaell thinks it is difficult to
                            over-estimate the importance of this discovery in connection with the
                            history of civilisation in general and the evolution of pottery in
                            particular. Some of the vessels have already been promised to the
                            British Museum.</p>
                    <p>Mr. de Rastafjaell, in an interview, told a.“ Daily Mail" representative that the M88.,which he had secured, were undoubtedly of very great
                            interest. The unique Nubian MS. h is a little bound volume, about 6ins.
                            by 4ins.It contains a history, or life of St. Menos, fone of the
                            early Christian martyrs.</p>
                    <p>There was only one person in England who t could read
                            Nubian-an official in the British Museum-but there were many who could . I make out a good
                            deal of it as the basis of the of language was Greek. He had had
                            considerable experience in Egyptian explorations, which he had followed up as a hobby. He had also ext|plored at
                            Cyzicus in Asia Minor, but all his discoveries there he had been obliged to leave behind him
                            in accordance with the Government regulations. He had had a very
                            tempting offer a for the Nubian volume from Germany, but he felt that it
                            should remain in England.</p>
