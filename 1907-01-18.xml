                    <head>ORIENTAL SCHOOL OF LANGUAGES.</head>
                    <p>It may be of interest to some of the English residents in Egypt to hear of a
                        new movement to create an Oriental School of Languages in London, Prof. Rhys
                        Davids, of Manchester (Professor of Comparative Theology at Manchester
                        University), lately had an interview with the Premier to put before him
                        proposals, which he embodied in a report, "Oriental Studies in England and
                        Abroad." Having passed some years in Egypt, and always having felt the want
                        of a thorough knowledge of the Arabic language, we feel that some of the
                        remarks of the learned savant on Oriental teaching will bear repeating. He
                        remarks : In attempting to state what is the actual provision made at
                        present in Great Britain for the teaching of Oriental languages and
                        subjects, we must distinguish between the teaching of the colloquial use of
                        the dialects and languages now spoken in the East, on the one hand, and on
                        the other the right interpretation of the ancient inscriptions and
                        literature, the right use of the rich historical evidence they have
                        preserved for us. In England no such indications are given by the title
                        used. And the complication between University and College payments tends
                        further to obscure the real facts. In the list of teachers attached to the
                        London University and its component Colleges there is an imposing array of
                        Oriental subjects. Only one of them holds a real professorship. Another has
                        a small allowance, scarcely sufficient for a research scholarship, attached
                        to it. Some, in spite of these adverse conditions, have done good original
                        work, and have been able to invite students to work in that direction. But
                        these have usually been men of private means. Apart from the teaching of
                        Hebrew to theological students the provision made in Great Britain and
                        Ireland is as follows: There is a chair of Sanskrit at Edinburgh, founded by
                        the late Dr. Muir. There are also chairs of Sanskrit at Oxford and
                        Cambridge, the former supported by private endowment, the latter provided by
                        the University. There are two chairs of Arabic, apart from Lord Almoner's
                        annual grants just referred to, at our old Universities. The chair of
                        Egyptology, lately founded at University College, London, by Miss Edwards,
                        should perhaps be added to the list. Egypt has been so intimately connected,
                        through the centuries, with its Asiatic neighbours in Syria, Assyria, and
                        Arabia, that the problems with which Egyptology has to deal are in a large
                        degree identical with those of Oriental research. Prof. Rhys-Davids now
                        points out that the total of teaching of a University standard is, there
                        fore, for Great Britain and Ireland, with a population of about farty
                        millions and with fourteen Universities, as follows: Five chairs or six, if
                        the one of Egyptology be included; eleven titular professorships with the
                        emolumients only of readerships; five readerships. </p>
                    <p>On the continent we find a different state of things, Holland, with a
                        population less than that of London, and with only four Universi ties, has
                        eight fully paid chairs and eight readerships. And if we turn to the
                        countries nearly equal in population to our own, we find Germany has no less
                        than fifty-one fully equipped chairs, besides fifty other lesser posts. It
                        may possibly be suggested, in order to explain away the importance of these
                        figures, that German professors are notoriously ill-paid. That is, however,
                        not so much now the case as it was. And the idea is largely due to the
                        confusion we make between the different class es of professors. If an
                        average be struck between the salaries of all the professors of various
                        kinds--16 (5+11) in England and 78 (51 +24+3) in Germany--the amount would
                        be Kreater in the German average. The elements of several of the more
                        important vernaculars spoken in India are taught at different Univer sities
                        in Great Britain and Ireland to assist candidates selected for the Indian

                    <p>in passing their second examination. Sometimes Indian Law and the Modern
                        History of India are added; and other Oriental languages useful for
                        candidates elsewhere. The teachers are all, except those in London, paid.
                        The Universities vie with one another for this class of students, who pay
                        fees, and the India Office helps Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin to the extent
                        of paying about one teacher. In Berlin, for instance, an Oriental Seminary
                        has been established, in elose connection with the University, and presided
                        over by the eminent Arabist, Hofrat Sacban. It has an annual grant of £8,000
                        a year, besides the necessary build ings, a fine library is provided, and
                        the seminary publishes an admirably conducted and very full quarterly
                        journal. But there is also provided a special staff of teachers for their
                        more practical wants. There are, amongst numerous others, two professors of
                        Arabic, and native teachers of the Arabic dialecte spoken in Syria, Egypt,
                        and Morocco. The French have in Paris a very similar school, the Ecole
                        spéciale des langues orientales vivantes. This school likewise is provided
                        with grant, buildings and library. In St. Petersburg the arrangements are
                        again different. There are four faculties in the University, one of history,
                        one of law, one of natural science, and one of Orientalism. The matter of
                        faculties is suggestive. How great must be the revolution in English opinion
                        on Oriental studies before, out of four faculties, one is devoted to
                        Orientalism! </p>
                    <p>The London University is just being built up on what are supposed to be the
                        most advanced lines. When the question of faculties was dicussed, an
                        application was made to the authorities to establish a faculty of Oriental
                        study. Needless to say no reply was vouchsafed. Now what are the reasons for
                        this comparative fervour that we find abroad in Oriental study. It is the
                        study of the origins of all the great religions of the world, and the
                        histories of inost. It is the study of three of the most interesting and
                        original systems of philosophic thought. We are learning that in all matters
                        of public administration, training and efficiency are matters of the first
                        importance. The chief officials at the Foreign, Indian, and Colonial Offices
                        and in the services abroad, and also our leading merchants, have acquired
                        their present high positions by qualities and abilities of a high order,
                        among which Oriental learning, save in certain exceptional instances, is not
                        included. They are apt to consider it of little value, and not only do not
                        encourage, but often discourage it. Yet the list of the exceptions would
                        show that it is not detrimental to distinguished service, but rather the
                        reverse. And we must never forget that the conditions have now changed, and
                        that just as we consider, in our naval estimates, foreign activity, so also
                        we should, as practical policy, make our Intelligence Department, in
                        Oriental matters, at least as strong as that of any two of the other great
                        Powers. The examinations are for the most part linguistic. No knowledge of
                        ideas, of history, or of literature are encouraged. The teachers are often
                        natives, whose education is not up to University standard, and a Uni.versity
                        training is not considered necessary even for the examiners, </p>
                    <p>To sum up Prof. Rhys-Davids' ideas, these seem to be the salient points :
                        (1.) The dominant factor in the situation is the supposed enormous wealth of
                        our old Universities, and the corollary that is always drawn; that is, the
                        pernicious and fatal one that Government should do nothing for higher
                        education in England. (II.) Our competitors abroad have taken, in recent
                        years, very judicious and im portant steps towards supplying their existing
                        deficiencies both in university teaching, and also in technical training in
                        these matters, (III.) The funds abroad are provided entirely by Government,
                        and the fees charged to students are either non-existent, or so small as to
                        be scarcely worth consideration.(IV.)Oriental history should be assigned the
                        importance it deserves in the schools of history at our Universities, and
                        every candidate in history should be compelled to show # moderato
                        acquaintance with the main results of Oriental research in this department.
                        (V.) Oriental philosophy should be recognised in the schools of philosophy
                        at our Universities; and every candidate should be compelled to show a
                        moderate acquaintance with its main features. (VI.) The ideal would be one
                        school in London, managed and governed on the same lines as the school in
                        Berlin,and branch schools both in Bombay and in some place in the Far East. </p>

                        <p>To the EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE." <lb/>Sir, I was moch grioved to
                            hear this morn<lb/>ing of the death of Desa Butober. I know him
                            <lb/>first in 1887, when I was in deep distress. No <lb/>person was more
                            sympathetio and brought <lb/>with him to ono o situated such a sense of
                            <lb/>comfort. Although not a member of his flook, I <lb/>always found,
                            as I believe all who came into <lb/>close contact with him did, whether
                            members <lb/>of the Church of Bogland or not, a scholar, <lb/>gentleman,
                            and, above all, &amp; most lovable <lb/>Christian, of besetifal
                            simplicity, rare breadth <lb/>of view, and the widest sympathies. </p>
                        <p>As I am unable to be present at his funeral <lb/>I would like, through
                            your colamos, to pay to <lb/>his memory my triboto of respeot,

                        <p>COMING CHANGES. </p>
                        <p>Various changes are semi officially foreshadowed as regards the Consular

                            partment, and to introduce an entirely indepandent organization. We are
                            also promined a more prompt publication of the reports from Consolar
                            official. Bot much more than that is required. When such reports are
                            issued only onos year, it matters very little if they are pablished
                            immadiate'y they are received, or whether they are in the printers'
                            bands a few weeks. Nothing less than a daily pablication would seem to
                            meet the requirements of the times. It will also be necessary to
                            consider, Ma correr pondent points out, wbether the service could not be

                        <p>The whole history of Great Britain ir, says the "Tempo," there to teach
                            the Bgyptisne the soppleness and the perfectibility of her official
                            policy. "Who would dare affia that England, who has given autonomy to
                            Canade, Australis, and the Transvaal, and is about to give it to the
                            Orange Colony, will not decide one day that the time has come in her own
                            interest, to grant autonomy to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>The Tempa concludes by saying that when England judges Egypt to be ripe
                            for the fuller measure of autonomy it is certain she will grant it. </p>
