                        <p>The weather has now settled down to wintry conditions. Yesterday was
                            again dull and cheerless. During the night a light gale sprangip from
                            the S.W., and continues till this morning, the wind being intensley
                            cold. The barometer is steady. Today promises to be dull and cold, and
                            some rain may fall.</p>

                    <head>THE HELLENIC CASE </head>
                    <p>M. Athos Romanos, the well-known Greek politician and ex-Minister for Foreign
                        Affairs in the previous Theotokis Cabinet, has just published a well-written
                        pamphlet on the persecution of his countrymen by the Bulgarians. As the
                        Greeks are being continually censured for their conduct to the Bulgarians in
                        Macedonia, it is only fair that it should be realised that there is another
                        side of the question.</p>
                    <p>M. Romanos has wisely accompanied his statements with photographs showing the
                        havoc wrought by the Bulgarians in the Greek Club and the Greek School at
                        Philippopolis, the latter founded by M. Maraslis, of Odense, the well-known
                        Greek philanthropist and patriot, and the almost complete destruction of the
                        Hellenic quarter of Anchialos, on the Black Sen. It is noticeable, as one of
                        these photographs demonstrates, that the conflagration, which destroyed nine
                        hundred Greek houses and shops, stopped, as if by miracle, before the walls
                        of the Bulgarian Church - miracle worthy of the Middle Ages, which was
                        doubtless intended to point the moral that walvation of | life and property
                        is to be found by those who follow the Bulgarian Exarch rather than by the
                        adherents of the Ecumenical Patriarch. The Bulgarians say that the fault lay
                        with the Greeks, who provoked reprisals by their resistance. It would have
                        been greatly to the discredit of the latter if they had not done so.
                        Anchialos contained six thousand Greeks, and when they saw one of their
                        compatriots fall, pierced by a Bulgarian bullet, they naturally fired on his
                        murderers. Not having many weapons they could not beat off the Bulgarian
                        bands, and the fire ere long rendered further resistance impossible,</p>
                    <p>M. Romanos complains bitterly that the Bulgarian Government has not restored
                        to his fellow-countrymen their churches and schools. The Bulgarian lion, he
                        wys waves over the Marasli school at Philippopolis, which has been
                        proclaimed State property, and no less than sixty-six Greek schools,
                        formerly attended by eight thousand pupils, have been closed by the
                        application of a clause in the Bulgarian Education Act of 1891 which has
                        hitherto been a dead letter. M. Romanos points out that this action
                        constitutes an infringement of the religious liberty guaranteed to the
                        Greeks of Bulgaria by the Berlin Treaty and by the Organic Statute of
                        Eastern Rumelia (now South Bulgaria). He might have added, that complete
                        religious toleration exists in Greece, whether the creed concerned be that
                        of the Roman Catholics of the Cyclades and the Ionian Islands or that of the
                        few Mussulmans who have remained in Thessaly since its retrocession to
                        Greece in 1898. The very first Article of the Greek Constitution, while
                        forbidding proselytism, guarantees complete religious liberty, and this is
                        not a mere rhetorical flourish of the Parliamentary draughtsman, but fact
                        The State subsidies the Turkish muftis of Thessaly, and Roman Catholics and
                        Jews have their own religious instruction in the public elementary
                        schools.</p>
                    <p>It is no doubt, unfortunate that the Eastern Christians should hate each
                        other so cordially, but they have always done so, and in that res peet they
                        differ only in degree from the more civilised Western Christians Europe,
                        however, is entitled to know that the fault is not all on one side and that
                        all Bulgarians are not angels and all Greeks are not the opposite. Finlay,
                        himself • Philhellene, could laugh during the War of Independence at the
                        extravagances of Philhellenism. But people are now in danger of going to the
                        opposite extreme that of thinking that the Greeks can do nothing right
                        because they have, like even the youngest of us, made some mistakes.</p>

                    <p>ENGLISH RESIDENTS INTREPIDITY</p>
                    <p>Very important seizures of hashish were made at Ramleh on Monday and
                        yesterday, which illustrate in a remarkable manner how adept the servants of
                        some of the most respectable fans in Berkeley are in running bashish. The
                        house of Mr. HC. Parkinson, the general manager of the Khedivial Mail
                        Steamship Company, is right on the lift at Berkeley, and is protected from
                        the inroads of the seas by an almost perpendicular sea wall. Access to the
                        house from the beach is obtained by some steps on the wall. The Coastguard
                        Administration's patrol cannot get to the coast at this point as the
                        approaches to the East and West are cloned by two walls to the end of the
                        cliff.</p>
                    <p>Early on Monday morning, at about 1 o'clock, Mr. Parkinson was aroused from
                        his slumbers by peculiar thudding noise. He went round the house and was
                        surprised to find light in his kitchen. He entered and found his suffrage
                        engaged in making tea. The suffrage said that it was bad to be out, and,
                        feeling cold, thought he would make some tea. This explanation did not,
                        however, not count for the strange noise, so Mr. Parkinson ordered the man
                        to go out and see if anybody was moving about in the er d'osure. The man
                        went off and came back soon afterwards declaring that he could not find a
                        soul outside, and that all was quiet.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Parkinson then went to bed again, but soon afterwards he again heard the
                        mysterious thud, thud, thud, jost outside his house. Rounded with people
                        walking in the yard of his horse dragging huge weights with them, and they
                        distinctly noted the footfalls. He determined to probe the mystery to its
                        depths and, arming himself with a loaded revolver, he went himself to
                        ascertain the truth. It was pitch dark night, and nothing could be
                        distinguished. Batas be was moving round and nearly stumbled over a big
                        sack. He at once goers what game was being played and recognised that
                        hasbieb was being landed. He went to his telephone and rang the Coast guard
                        station at Ramelb, which is only about five hundred metres off. Help was at
                        once sent and eighteen sacks of bashish were found round about the
                        enclosure. One of the sacks was brought to light hidden in the room of Mr.
                        Parkinson's suffragette.</p>
                    <p>The importance of this seizure may be recognised when it is known that the
                        selling price of such an amount of hashish would be between L.E. 4,500 and
                        L.E. 5,000, for the sacks contained twelve hundred kilo over a ton's
                        weight</p>
                    <p>The suffrage was handed over by Mr. Parkinson to the Coast Guard, who took
                        him into custody. Evidently the sacks of hashish had been floated in from a
                        boat lying in the offing, as it is impossible to eftaota landing there
                        except on moonlight night. The smugglers must have been very somerous as it
                        would require at least ten men to marry off seob a large haal. When Mr.
                        Parkinson was ringing up the telephone to the Coast Guard he heard the sound
                        of the whole carriage driving rapidly away. This no doubt contained some of
                        the smugglers.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday, when the coast guard were taking the suffrage to the Customs
                        Administration Commission in order to be brought to trial, he said that he
                        had some news to tell them, and he volunteered the information that if they
                        I would look in the stable of the house adjoining Mr. Parkinson's, which is
                        inhabited by Mr. Borohgrevink, the Procureur General of the Mixed Tribunals,
                        they would find another tres tre trove of ashish. Subsequently, on a search
                        being made, tourteen sacks were found hidden under the tibia in Mri.
                        Borchgrevink's stable. His native coachman, who has been Gitteen years in
                        bis service, is about to be taken into custody. Both be and Mr. Parkinson's
                        suffrage were most respectable servants. The latter was in the service of
                        Major Mackenzie Pendrell for some time. Evidently the servants in houses by
                        the sea at Ramleh are corrupted by the smugglers, who are quite able to
                        offer Snormons bribes of hundreds of pounds for 9-operation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Parkinson and his next-door neighbour, Mr. C.A.H. Alderson, have now
                        given the Coast Guard Administration permission to station a guard within
                        their enclosures, as this part of the coast is evidently convenient pace for
                        running hashish I To show how carefully laid were the sung Iglars plans on
                        this occasion, we must mention that Mr. Parkinson on Sunday night did not
                        notice his fax terrier and only saw it again at about 7 o'clock next
                        morning, when it oame home collarless and lame. It had been removed the day
                        before and tied up some way off. flag the dog been in the bonae, it would
                        have at once given the salary,</p>
                    <p>Two hours after the discovery of the hashish "the Coastguards in the Eastern
                        Harbour were arrested . suspicious looking native craft, which | welt

                        the same odont. It bore a Greek label. The boat and crew were taken into
                        custody and the latter are to be brought before the Custom Commission.</p>
                    <p>It is understood that the bashish found at Bulkeley was brought over from
                        Greece in sobooner, which was met off Aboukir by vative boat There is no
                        doubt that this great se zute of £5,000 worth of ba hsh is entirely due to
                        the plook of Mr. Parkinson, who ventured out alone at a time when there must
                        have been at least ten smugglers in the bus compound, all of them desperate
                        at the prospect of losing such a valuable cargo.</p>

                        appears that on June 11, 1906, the Municipality beld meeting to discuss the
                        question of lighting the streets of the towa with gas or electricity, and
                        finally appointed committee of four of its members, including the sab

                        various systems. After a study of their comparative merite the committee
                        drew up a report in favour of the adoption of electric lighting. The
                        Ministry of Public Works had other views. Mr. Perry. Under Secretary of
                        State for Towns and Buildings, in note addressed to Sir W. Garstin,
                        Recommended the adoption of the Mansfield gas system. The Municipality,
                        however, read the report sud voted for eleo tricity, and there the matter
                        resta · In our opinion, the Zaganigians (or should - write Zgarie Pea) might
                        be left to choose for themselves aplex their proposal is likely to involve

                        on the roads, particularly the most frequented thoroughfare has been such a
                        to leave them in a very bad condition unless they are properly looked

                    <p>We are aware of the financial difficulties which stand in the way of lavish
                        expenditure on the roads; and until the water works are an accomplished
                        fact, it will not be easy to keep the roads in good condition. Besides, the

                        snobs of which large amounts of money are urgently required. But in voicing
                        the public opinion on this matter we hope that some means may be found to

                        overwhelming with its grent genius the work of that patient hack.</p>

                    <head>KHEDIVIAL CLUB DANCE.</head>
                    <p>The dance given last night by the members of the Khedivial Club was a very
                        great success. Notwithstanding the bad weather that prevailed there were 400
                        guests present. It is needless to say that the olav's preemies looked their
                        best, profusely decorated as they were with the choicest plants and
                        brilliantly lit op with altitude of electrie lampe. By eleven o'clock the
                        large reading room, which is used as a ball-room, was full, and doing bad
                        began. The scene presented was charming in the extreme. The ladies were most
                        bands only be owned, the light colours of their beautiful tulettes
                        contracting with the dark green opi form of the 60tbR flash and the red
                        costs of the Dublin Fusiliers, the officers of both their regiments being
                        present in fall foron. It is quite impossible to give the names of thore
                        present ; but we noticed H. B. the Governor of Alexandria, the officers of
                        the Army of Occupation, the Consular Cerpe, judges, Government officials,
                        and the elite of the English and foreign society.</p>
                    <p>A most excellent rapper, for which the elub is renowned, was served to over
                        10 guests, after which the cotillon began. Mrs. Rees and Miss Holland,
                        assisted by Mr. Sidney Wilkio. son and Mr. Reer, led this dance, and it was
                        due to their efforts that it proved huge Success. The presents given away
                        were profese, and in some cases of a very rich nature. The greatest prison
                        is due to the ladies we have mentioned, who took the atmoet pains and were
                        indefatigable in their attentions to every great. Such was their agreement
                        that the cotillion, which began at 1 o'clock, did not end until four a.m. </p>
                    <p> Before ending our report of this most successful dance, we must mention that
                        all the members of the club did their best to entertain their guests, and
                        were ably supported by their active secretary.</p>
