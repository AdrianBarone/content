                    Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel accommodation
                    for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr. Najem Houry
                    proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent
                    Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to
                    Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
                    Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                    Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                    begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                    Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                    scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                    in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

It is a remarkable document, frozi whatever point of view it may be regarded and we are convinced that it will make a profound impression on all its readers, for it diseusses with a remarkable frankness and plainness of speech all those questions which the events of the past year have invested with a more than academic importance Egyptian Nationalism and its aims disguised or avowed, the extraordinary vigour, to use a mild 'term, of the criticisms of the Pan-Islamic Press, above all the great question of the Capitulations are all discussed with admira' le lucidity and strength.
                        We expect that the European colonies in Egypt will be most interested in the last mentioned of these issues. Many of us-perhaps too many--are inclined to regard frontier incidents with indifference, t. ask no questions as to the political future of Egypt, to regard most forms of Egyptian Nationalism with mild amusement or bored acquiescence, and to concern ourselves only with the affairs of our particular colony-and the condition of the share or cotton market. But we have all ali certain interest in the Capitulations, which are, to all intents and purposes, our constitution, and no European will but listen with interest to Lord Cromer's proposals as given in his latest report.

                    <p>Lord Cromer complains-and with justice-that his proposals have been unfairly
                        treated in being described as involving "the abolition of the
                        Capitulations." They should mather be said to constitute a "modification of
                        the Capitulations" by which the British Empire takes the place of fifteen
                        different powers. What then are these proposals? We have not the space to
                        give them in full, but we can give at least a summary which will sbow how
                        they affect the average European resident of Egypt for whose benefit they
                        have been made. 1. Should Lord Cromer's proposals be accepted, instead of
                        legislation by diplomacy in all matters regarding European residents in
                        Egypt we shall liave legislation by a local Council composed entirely of
                        Europeans, and subject to the British and Exyptian Governments. No law now
                        requiring the consent of the puwers can come into force until it has been
                        accepted by a majority of the Council and approved by the above mentioned
                        Government 2. Europeans shall be deprived of no right or privelege which
                        they now enjoy under the Capitulations without any adequa e guar. antee
                        being given against the recurrence of the abuses against which their rights
                        and privileges were intended to guard." 3. The Mixed Courts will to all
                        intents and purposes continue to exist under a local obligation, to
                        administer laws passed by the European Legislative Council and approved by
                        the British and Egyptian Governments. Their internationalism is affirmed and
                        a threefold guarantee is offered that there sball be no break in the
                        continuity of the codes which they administe. These guarantees are :
                        firstly, a proposed declaration of the British and Egyptian Governments,
                        secondly, the international character of the cuncil, and thirdly, doabttul
                        questions to be referred 'to the Hague Tribunal 4. The rights of Europeans
                        accused on criminal charges are secured by a series of guaranteus which will
                        ensure that the future European Criminal Courts will adininister justice in
                        * manner at least as satisfactory" as that of the Consular Courts. 5.
                        Domiciliary visits will not be permitted without the authorization of a
                        magistrate who is the subject of a treaty power and the presence of an
                        officer of the court who is a subject of a treaty power. "In other words
                        when a domiciliary visit is effected in the house of an Englishman, a
                        Frenchman, or a German, resident in Cairo or Alexandria, the process will be
                        similar to that which would have taken place in London, Paris, or Berlin,
                        with the exception that the agents employed in carrying on the search
                        instead of being Englishmen, Frenchmen, or Germans may be of some other
                        nationality." 6. In all cases of arrest a European will have the right to be
                        at once liberated on bail or to be brought before a European magistrate
                        within 24 hours of his arrest. Into the question of the composition of the
                        Council we cannot now go. It is important and interesting, but far more
                        important is ord Cromer's note (p 11) on the duration of the British
                        Occupation of Egypt. Here we have the guarantee that the new system, if
                        adopted, well not be nullified by reason of any sudden reversal of British
                        policy, "the question of the 1 duration of the occupation is left to the
                        discretion of the British Government. It will last as long as that
                        Government considers. it necessary in the interests of all concerned, in the
                        welfare and good government of Egypt”... His Majesty's Government "recognise
                        that the maintenance and development of such reforms as have hitherto been
                        effected in Egypt depend upon the British Occupation. This consideration
                        will apply with equal strength to any changes effected in the regime of the
                        capitulations His Majesty's G verdient therefore wish it to be understood
                        that there is o reason for allowing the prospect of any modifications in
                        that regime to be prejudiced by the existence of the British Occupation of
                        the country. We commend this declaration to the attention of our nationalist
                        critics. It is of great importance to every resident in Egypt, European and
                        native, from the Khedive to the humblest fellah, giving as it does the
                        surest of guarantees that the onward march of Egypt shall not be turned to
                        retreat by the forces of absolutism or reaction. </p>

                <p>In the House of Commons on Monday week Mr. H. C Lea asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether his attention had been drawn to the resolution come to by the Egyptian authorities to proceed with the increasing of the height of the Assouan dam by seven metres; whether last year doubts were raised by men of scientific eminence as to whether the strains and stresses at present , borne by the Assouan dam had been properly calculated; whether he had satisfied himself as to these fears by inquiry of the best engineering experts ; and, if not, would he consider the advisability of suggesting to the authorities in Egypt the appointment by them of a small committee of scientific men to go thoroughly into the matter, and so obviate the possibility of an accident happening which might cause disastrous loss of life and property
                    Mr Runciman replied that a despatch had · been received from Lord Cromer explaining
                    the reasons which had led the Egyptian Government to arrive at the decision to raise the dam. In due course it would be presented to Parliament. In the meanwhile, it was not desirable to answer questions upon isolated points in connection with the matter.

                <p> The ordinary general meeting of the Um Rus Gold Mines of Egypt (Limited) was held last week in London. Mr. John Harvey presided and after referring to the history of the mine, he stated that the mining reports seemed to indicate a position which was growing from bad to worse, and those received of late held out no inducement to the company to continue operations. The opinion of the board and of the managers was that operationsshould cease in order to prevent money from being frittered away in useless operations. Sir Henry Bunbury seconded the motion. After a shareholder had expressed strong dissatisfaction with the state of affairs, the report was adopted. By an informal resolution the shareholders present expressed the opinion that the operations should be discontinued and the assets disposed of with a view to the liquidation of the company.

                <p> The following details of the visit of the famous French painter, M Chartran, in Egypt appears in the latest «Gaulois :".
                    “ Des bords du Nil, nous arrive l'écho des honneurs dont a i té l'objet l'un de nos grands artistes, M. Chartran
                    « Présenté à S. A. le Khédive, au palais d'Abdine, par M Chevandier de Valdrôme, gérant diplomatique de la 1.gation de France, il a été accueilli par le prince avec une grâce souriante et un intérêt tout particulier.
                    “ Le Khedive n'ignorait ni le talent ni les belles œuvres de M. Chartran. Il l'a questionne longuement sur son séjour en Egypte et lui a témoigné la plus vive sympathie.
                    " Quelques jours plus tard, un banquet était! offert à M. et , Mme Chartran, préside, par, M. de Valdrôme, au Club kh-divial, qui est le premier cercle du Caire et le plus recherché. Parmi les con ives : Mme Klobukowski, Mme Paul Bert, M.

                    “ M Chartran n'était allé en Egypte que pour se reposer, mais qui laisse reposer le talent? La légation de France lui e organisé un atelier lans så merveilleuse residence, construite en tyle arabe par le comte de Saint-Maurice, et 'éminent artiste a tout de suite accepté de aire le portrait de la comtesse de Serionne, ine des plus charmantes femmes de la colonie française, dont le mari, représentant de la Soiété du canal de Suez, oocupe une haute situaion au Caire."

                <head>K.S.C. GYMKHANA</head>
                <p> </p>
                <p>The last gymkhana of the season was held under most favourable circumstances,
                    being graced by the presence of our Royal visitors, H.H. the Khedive and Lady
                    Cromer, and being favoured by one of the brightest and warmest days we have seen
                    this year. H.H. the Khedive arrived quite early in the afternoon and was present
                    in the royal box in time to witness the first event. It must have been about
                    half past three that the carriage containing the Duke and Duchess of Connaught
                    and Lady Cromer entered the ground, driving across the turf, preceded by mounted
                    policemen and escorted by two officials on bicycles, and in front of the grand
                    stand and enclosure to the box, where they were greeted by the Khedive, Major
                    General Bullock, Sir Vincent Corbett, Sir William Garstin and others. Princess
                    Victoria arrived shortly afterwards and dur ag the afternoon various ladies had
                    the honour of being invited to the royal enclosure. The events of the afternoon
                    were of à most popular and entertaining nature, and though there were several
                    accidents there were none of a serious nature. The jumping competition was most
                    interesting, Captain Leigh's prowess evoking great enthusiasm, and the pig
                    sticking competition caused general amusement, the pig, represented by an
                    inflated water skin at the end of a long rope, proving a most sporting and
                    highly eccentric target. The polo match on donkeys too proved most entertaining,
                    for the humble quadrupeds had no idea of what was expected of them, and anbled
                    about in an aimless fashion, stumbling whenever they could, with a delightful
                    unconcern of the rules of the game. It was a difficult game to follow, even
                    though pace was no object, and the ball was a big one ; but it proved one of the
                    most interesting events of the afternoon, and doubtless afforded the donkeys
                    material for cogitation during the coming months of summer idleness. There was
                    so much to watch and so many people to notice that there was little time to
                    regret the passing of so nany of our late visitors. The stand was full
                    throughout the afternoon, and most of the résidents were to be seen in the
                    enclosure. Mrs and Miss Bullock and Mrs. Findlay were įmong those who finished
                    the afternoon in he royal box, and Lord and Lady Lanesborongh ind Lady Vivian
                    were noticed during the įfternoon the latter with Mrs. Rom who was vearing a
                    most delightful frock of maslin potted with black and with deep black edged
                    orderings of watteau design and colouring. The Misses York were wearing the very
                    prettiest of white mu-lin frocks, and Miss Leverich was also in white with a
                    blue sash. Miss Erskine Shaw who came with Mrs. and Miss Bennett, was much
                    admired in a beautifully fitting semi-Empire frock of biscuit cloth and Mrs.
                    Montague Summer's toilette of vieux rose voile, with passementerie of dull gold
                    about the lace yoke was most becoming Bcth Mrs Nolan and Miss Moore were in
                    muslin, the one having pink ribbons and the other white run through the lace
                    insertions ; and Miss Luck was wearing a sweetly pretty frock of fine black and
                    white striped muslin with a lace corsage showing under the little bolero, The
                    Misses de Villebois were dressed alike in blue silk, and the Misses Çoles were
                    in pink. Among others present were the Countess Hedda Brookdorff, Sir John and

                <head>M. De Feraudy</head>
                <p>If circumstances compelled our absence on Monday at the first of a welcome series
                    of plays, we are not conceited enough to ima. gine we owe any apology other than
                    to M. de Féraudy and his company. And it is not a mere shuffling excuse to say
                    that if his Isidore Lechat of ļast Monday was as masterly and vehement as when
                    we last saw him. in the part, the performance was beyond criticism, M de Féraudy
                    is perhaps at his best in "Les Affaires sont les Affaires" and it was a sine quâ
                    non that the play is included in his repertory ; at the same time he no doubt
                    fully realised the boldness of producing it here, for the Lechats, like the
                    poor, are always with us and nowhere more so than in Alexandria ; it is quite on
                    the cards that some were present on Monday and we are sorry to have missed an
                    interesting spectacle, viz the real Lechats' scrutiny of M. de Feraudy's
                    treatment of the subject. We do not for a moment say we have mot any Lechats to
                    equal that of M de Féraudy, or rather of Octave Mirbeau ; they have probably not
                    been victims to circumstances in which to shew such strength of character or it
                    may be they want. the strength of character which would render similar tense and
                    bittar circum. stances feasible. But both the real and stage Lechats (and there
                    is little to choose between them) thanks to M. Mirbeau's ingenuity and M. de
                    Féraudy's remarkable conception of the part, are at any rate free from the
                    hyprocrisy of concealing a love and display of wealth, which is a decided merit.
                    There were no special merits about any of the characters (if such mere talking
                    machines can be so called) in "Paraitre," which was given last night. M Donnay
                    has attempted,like so many modern playwrights, to denounce the shortcomings of
                    society and in particular to break a lance with snobbishness, which is
                    practically co-existent with society. His intention is praiseworthy enough from
                    a moralist's point of view but his way of expressing it in this
                    four-act-five-scene pièce de salon is singularly unconvincing. There is so much
                    irrelovant talk, so many unnecessary persons that it is difficult to get at the
                    backbone of the play at all. Perhaps one is not meant to get there, for
                    everything is done to divert one's attention with a series of intrigues and
                    liaisons of an extraordinary description. Furthermore many of the impersonators
                    should be provided with some palpable cause or other for entering and leaving
                    the stage and for indulging in long and often lugubrious conversation.. The
                    brunt of trying to keep the audience interested fell upon Mmes Van Doren (the
                    injured wife ) Bressan (the transgressing wife) MM. Sévérin (the transgressing
                    husband) and Bauer (the injured husband and incidentally i he brother of the
                    injured wife.) M. de Feraudy's part was quite a supernumerary one and he charmed
                    his audience more by his reposeful speech and gesture than by anything very
                    striking in the shape of dialogue.</p>

                <p> sonnelles des conseillers et des intérêts vitaux de la Ville, qu'ils ont cependant à cour.
                    On débute avec les communications diverses M. le Baron de Menasce eroit devoir rectifier une inexactitude parue dans un journal lui prêtant à la dernière assemblée une attitude qu'il n'a pas prise à l'égard du Directeur Général des Donanes. Il insiste pour que le compte rendu officiel paraisse dans un journal au moins..
                    M. Salvago demande ensuite une application plus rigoureuse par la police du Règlement sur les Automobiles. Il signale les nombreux dangers que touré debwiiement le public durs its principales rues de la ville et propose comme palliatif certainės mesnres pratiques.
                    Une discussion s'ensuit à laquelle prennent part M.M. Padoa Bey, Rothaker, de Menasce, qui critiquent le Règlement en vigueur.
                    M. Borghrevink répond à ces critiques en disant que ce Règlement n'est pas aussi doux qu'on le prétend puisque il prévoit même l'emprisonnement comme penalité. Il propose néanmoins d'attirer l'attention du Gouvernement sur l'insuffisance de ce Règlement en ce qui concerne la vitesse qui est fixée à 15 kilomètres à l'heure au centre de la ville et qui ne fixe pas de limite hors de la ville
                    La motion suivante est par conséquent votée : La Commission exprime le veu que le Gouvernement prenne d'urgence les mesures voulues contre la vitesse excessive des automobiles qui occasionne des dangers et des inconvénients incessants et renvoie aussi une at de plus approfondie à l'examen du Conten
                    tieux.
                    La Commission donne ensuite commnnication de plusieurs lettres ministérielles entre cutres une émanant du Ministère des Travaux Publics qui explique l'impossibilité d'avaisser la voie ferrée actuelle.
                    M. de Menasce propose une déviation de ette ligne qui constitue une barrière gêlante au centre de la ville et qui privera "au quartier de Moharem bey la vue sur les parcs projetés Sur la demande de M. Rothaker, la Sommission décide de demander aux services omp-tents les côtes et le coût du projet.
                    M. Rieti d-veloppe enfin son interpellation ur les maisons à bon marché. Il fait avec Jeaucoup de clarté l'historique de la question qui traine d puis si longtemps et qui risque de 'éterniser sans un sacrifice de la part de la leterniser sans un sacrifice de la part de la Municipalité. Il propose donc à celle-ci de faire bandon de la quote part qui lui revient dans a vente du terrain destiné par le Gouvernenent aux maisons ouvrières. Un groupe de inanciers est disposé à préter son concours à ette euvre intéressante et accepte d'ores et léjà à se soumettre à toutes les conditions que oudra bien lui imposer la Municipalités Me 'adoa bey fait remarquer que ces financiers hilanthropes parlent d'un taux de 5 et 5 1/2 %.
                    Sur la demande de ce deruier la Commission journe toute décision jusqu'à la prochaine. Lssemblée, afin de permettre au Comité nommé d hoe de fournir dans cet intervalle les plans t devis ainsi que tous les éléments nécessaires our lui permet re de se prononcer en con: aissa..ce de cause,
                    M. E. Stross expose ensuite la question de introduction de l'eau filtrée à Ramleh, qu'il oudrait voir à la portée de tous les habitants.
                    s'élève contre les agissements de la Com agnie des Eaux envers le public et contre le conopole de l'eau qu'il ret ent plus onéreux ue celui du gaz ou de l'électricité dont on est tant préoccupé dernièrement.
                    M. Salvago déclare, en sa qualité d'Adminisateur de la dite Compagnie, que cette dernière st disposée à accueillir favorablement tout rojet que la Municipalité voudra bien lui resenter en modification de ses arrangements ntérieurs. Il reconnait quelques défauts au ystème actuel, mais promet d'y apporter remède. les franches déclarations ont produit la leilleure impression. Mr S. Abani Bey a fait éanmoins une charge à fond contre la Companie en denonçant énergiquement ses procédés rbitraires.
                    Sur la proposition de Me Padoa Bey la Comission délégne M. Chataway pour rechercher, e concert avec les Administrateurs de la dite ompagnie, le meilleur moyen d'arriver à un rrangement permettant une fourniture d'ean Itrée à des conditions plus raisonnables.
                    La séance est levée à 7 h. 30, la continua. on de l'ordre du jour est renvoyée à la prohaine assemblée.
