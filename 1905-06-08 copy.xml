                    <hi rend="bold">FRANCE'S FOREIGN POLICY. The new Fronoh Minister for Foreign
                        Affair will, we are informed, "uphold the Russian alliance, bąt will
                        probably iosist on Russia guaranteeing that in fotore she will not take any
                        action to jeopardise its utility, and will show herself more amenable to her
                        ally's advice." These words are somewhat indefinite but they clearly show
                        that Rassia's plight is a matter of serious preoccupation to her ally.
                        France is traversing &amp; real crisis. The late Baron Rothschild reckoned
                        the amount of French capital sunk in Russia at eleven milliards of francs,
                        that is to say, at more than twice the war indemnity paid by France to
                        Germany. Now, however distasteful the alliance may be to the Republican
                        spirit in the country, it is impossible for any Government to cut loose
                        therefrom. Anything done politically wbich would weaken the hold of France
                        upon the creditor, would be immediately hailed by the people as an aot of
                        treachery. A Government that attempted it would inevitably fall, and perhaps
                        the régime with it. Knowing that, and knowing, also, that if the war onds in
                        the final humiliation of Russia, which is more than likely in the
                        circumstances, the French people may whistle for their capital, and even for
                        their interest, M, Rouvier's preoccupations may well be imagined. M.
                        Deloassé endeavoured to stave off the evil day by supporting Russia to the
                        utmost of his power, and by interpreting the neutrality question in a manner
                        which, at least, did not embarrass the movements of Rodjestvensky.
                        Apparently he thought by 80 doing that the Russian Admiral would regain the
                        command of the sea. But he was deceived.</hi>

                        civilisation. On the Continent of Europe it was they who performod the rough

                        have been so few and 50 tinorous. There is no country in which the
                        denunciation of the Russian autocracy and its agents has been so spontaneous
                        and irreprossible. The French have, indeed, felt in a special degree the
                        ignominy of what has happened. They cannot quite acquit them selves, as the
                        allies of Russian of all the responsibility, or at least of all the
                        disgrace. They were never before so conscious of the gulf that separates
                        them from the Russian Government. The realisation of this by the common
                        sentiment of the French people is the immediate result of the St. Petersburg
                        mas. sacre. It cannot, as some think, leave things as they were. It is
                        bound, we are told, to have political results. And what those results will
                        be is plainly stated. The weakening of the ties that bind Rassia and France
                        in alliance is regarded as a probable, or even inevitable, consequence of
                        the recent events and there appears to be a general expectation that the
                        intense feeling of humiliation and repulsion with which France bas watched
                        these events will loosen the corner-stone of her entire foreign polioy and
                        create an atmosphere which will invalidate, if not dissolve, the Dual
                        Alliance.</hi>

                    <hi rend="bold">largely be thanked for it. Internal peace must, therefore, be
                        set down as one of the compensations derived from it by France. External
                        peace it has yet more obviously guaranteed. There is, as things now are, no
                        chance whatever of France being threatened and humiliated by any such
                        movement as Bismarck is said to have meditated in 1875. The alliance removed
                        the sense of helplessness ander which France was laboaring twenty years ago.
                        These are two inestimable benefits derived by France from the alliance, and
                        they are well understood by all close observers of Earopean affairs.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="bold">Nor is this all. France derives from the alliance with Russia
                        advantages which no other Power conld undertake to provide. It is an
                        excellent thing that France should now be on terms of cordial confidence
                        with Italy and with ourselves. It is yet more excellent that after many
                        years of anxiety, nervousness, and insecurity the Republic should now have
                        entered the zone of hopefulness, and inspiriting baoyanoy. Bat it is
                        doubtful whether Great Britain or Italy could possibly render to France one
                        form of assistance of which she might some day be in vital need. It was
                        until recently believed that that help could be given by Russia, and this
                        was the belief ander which France entered the Dual Alliance. The question
                        now is whether, in view of recent events in the Far East and in Russia, this
                        determining consideration needs to be modified. Meantime it is evident that
                        the Republic has gained by the Dual Alliance, both at home and abroad, and
                        it is not by any means clear that the dissolution of the alliance would be
                        &amp; gain to France. She would be no; merely parting with an ally, she
                        would be throwing into that ally's arms the very Power from whom she must
                        always have the most to fear. We can only begin to gaage the preventive and
                        deterrent efficacy of the Dual Alliance by imagining it at an end. Some
                        thirty odd years ago Carlyle wrote : "That noble, patient, deep, and solid
                        Germany should be at length welded into &amp; nation and become Queen of the
                        Continent, instead of vapouring, Vainglorious, gesticulating, quarrelsome,
                        restless, and oversensitive France, seems to me the hopefullest public fact
                        that has occurred in my time." Germany has become better known since then,
                        and of the two nations we should not to-day say that it is France that is
                        vainglorious, or restless, or quarrelsome. Those who expect the dissolution
                        of the Dual Alliance should try and work out what its disappearance would
                        mean to France, to Germany, to the present balance of power in Europe, and,
                        therefore, to Great Britain,</hi>

                    <div type="item">
                        <p>The action of the Norwegian Parliament in dissolving the union must
                            either lead to war or to the acctptance of the situation by Sweden. The
                            divergence of view is really of old standing, dating back almost to the
                            earliest days of the union of the two kingdoms. That the possibility. of
                            a conflict was foreseon from the first is evident from the declaration
                            made by the first Sovereign of the united states, King Carl XIII., who
                            in 1815 pointed out in a Royal "proposition" that “when two nations of
                            their own accord submit to the same Government it is incumbent with the
                            greatest care to avoid differences of any kind arising in regard to
                            their relation to the common Regent. Otherwise the union sooner or
                            later. will be broken, and either the one people will soon subjugate the
                            other or their violent disruption will sow the seed of bitter dissension
                            which may for centuries keep them apart.” In the case of Norway and
                            Sweden no precaution which the circumstances of the time could suggest
                            appears to have been neglected. The separate existence of the two
                            States, united by the golden link of the Crown, was fully recognised,
                            but the wisest of statesmen cannot possibly foresee and provide for
                            every development which the future may have in store. In all their
                            internal relations the maximum of freedom was secured, to each State to
                            progress along its own lines. Each has its own legislature, its own
                            laws, its own system of finance, its own methods of raising revenue and
                            regulating its trade relations, both with its partner and with the rest
                            of the world. Each, again, has its own Army and its own Navy, and it is
                            only in their relations with other States that any serious difficulty
                            has manifested itself. The Norwegians, with their Monarchical
                            traditions, were content that the conduct of foreign relations should
                            remain the prerogative of the Sovereign, but, when, in 1885, a change in
                            the Swedish Constitution brought the conduot of foreign affairs more
                            directly under the control of the Swedish Ministry, it is not surprising
                            that a people so tenacious of their rights, and so ready to discern an
                            attack on their status as a Sovereign State, should take alarm at what,
                            viewed from the standpoint of Sweden, may have seemed a legitimate
                            development of the constitutional principle of Ministerial
                            responsibility. The controversy which twenty years ago assumed definite
                            shape has been allowed to drag on ever since, while each successive
                            attempt to arrive at a settlement has resulted in failura and has left
                            behind it an increasing bitterness of feeling until now the aged King
                            Oscar is face to face with the terrible dilemma of either having to
                            begin what would be virtually a civil war or acqaiesce in the disrgption
                            of Scandinavia. It is unfortunate that this contretemps should have
                            occurred on the eve of the marriage of Prinod Gustavus, which is to take

                        and one where he vill receive better treatment than he from his late
                        employers. Mr. Davison hag during his residence here gained the good-will
                        and esteem of the whole province for his straightforwardness, and both Mrs.
                        Davison and he will be missed by many friends. This, I I think, is the

                            away from all the other boatų and came in an easy first, and therefore
                            carried off Chitty Bey's cop. This boat will mae next week under the
                            name of "Sans Paroille" u she has changed owners, and now belongs to Mr.
                            H. de Teokadi. The "May" brought up the rear, and it is a pity that in
                            doing so she should have forced her right-of-way with the winning boats
                            of the other class n thereby she herself gained nothing and imporilled
