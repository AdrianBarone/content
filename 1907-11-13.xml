                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For
                        information apply to Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co.,
                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's
                        “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>AN ARRAIGNMENT OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE.</head>

                    <p>Prof. Henry Jones discussed in a very intér- esting way Mr. Hobhouse’s
                        arraignment(of the English people which he published in his book “Democracy
                        and Reaction.” The Profes- sor’s article (the first apparently of two)
                        appears in the November number of the “Contempor- ary Review,” and is
                        entitled “Idealism and Politics.”</p>

                    <p>“Mr. Hobhouse ‘bas made it easy for his critics to show towards his opinions
                        that rever- ence which is implied in the careful weighing of hie words,”
                        admits Prof. Jones. “He has displayed learning, diligence,
                        disinterestedness, and power in other fields of inquiry. . Further- more,
                        his opinions are ratified, though not without some significant
                        qualifications, by one whose experience in letters and in practical politics
                        bas the breadth and maturity of Mr. Morley’s, 1 propose, then, to take Mr.
                        Hob- house's arraignment of the English people, and his account o the causes
                        which, in his view,</p>

                    <cb n="6"/>

                    <p>have brought about their degradation, as the deliberate expression of a calm
                        opinion, which has been reluctantly adopted because forced upon him by a
                        wide and careful survey of the facts.</p>
                    <p>“There is one consideration, however, which will weigh with a critic who
                        would be sympe- thetic as well as just. Mr. Hobhoose’s book was evidently
                        inspired in great part by the Soath African War and the incidents which led
                        to it. The character of that war, or at least of the conditions which
                        brought it about, was such as to pause deep misgivings in many minds, and to
                        disturb the calm of many quietly thoughtful men. These events have left a
                        stain upon the national honour, And nothing can quite remove it: not even
                        the unexampled magnanimity shown by British statesmanship in restoring
                        freedom to the conquered people. The blatant imperialism and reckless greed
                        which helped to bring about the conflict and the sane and farsighted
                        imperialism which, so far as possible, has removed its evil effects will
                        stand upon the pages of our history in a contrast which nothing can
                        mitigate.</p>
                    <p>“If Mr. Hobhouse in his ‘Democracy and Reaction’ had limited his condemnation
                        to the events of the time, I should be little disposed to object to his
                        statements. But the question raised by him is not that of the war, nor of
                        the Raid, nor of the arrested inquiry into the Raid, nor.of the action of
                        the Government then in power, nor of the temporary lapse of a people from
                        the ways of political rectitude under the exciting influences of a great
                        conflict. [t is a far wider and graver question. It is the question whether
                        these facts, amongst others, can be justly taken as symbols of political
                        degradation—of a degradation so general as to affect the whole people, and
                        so deep as to reach the intellectual and moral sources of their action, and
                        to change the permanent conditions of their existence. Such is the view
                        taken by Mr. Hobhouse, supported in some respects by Mr. Morley, arid urged
                        with eloquence and the manifest sincerity of a noble passion. We cannot pass
                        it over it seems to me, nor deal lightly with it. We must examine it, and
                        inquire into the grounds of his rage and sorrow.</p>
                    <p> “His charge summarily stated is as follows :— ‘Daring some twenty or thirty
                        years a wave of reaction has spread over the civilised world,’ and ‘the
                        reaction has invaded one department of thought after another.’ As regards
                        the British people, ‘the reaction at home is inter- woven with reaction
                        abroad ; and if it is to be summed op mm a word, we should call it a
                        reaction against humanitarianism.’ “The bare conception of right in public
                        matters has lost its force.’ ‘Human wrongs and sufferings do not move us as
                        they~did.’ ‘There has been a far-reaching change in the temper of the
                        time.</p>
                    <p>“Following these accusations against the people as a whole comes his faithful
                        dealing with different sections of it, ‘the great middle class,’ he says,
                        ‘has become contented with its lot; and is far more moved by its fear of
                        Socialism than by any further instalment of privilege.’ The true leaders of
                        the middle class are the financiers, who show them how to get more than 8
                        per cent..on their investments.” They are infected with ‘collective
                        selfishness.’ ‘All they know of social and domestic reform is that it means
                        expense ; and their politics are summed up in the simple and comprehensive
                        formula: “Keep down the rates.”</p>
                    <p>“The common people have sunk still lower, if that be possible. They have
                        learnt to read, they are not educated. ‘Properly speaking, we have no
                        educated classes.’ Principles of justice have lost their value to as tor
                        want of imagina- tion to realise their significance. “The easy materialism
                        of our own time wants to hear no more of principles in politics, and how
                        they are endangered and how maintained.’ ‘Even the ordinary article of the
                        old journalism has proved far too long and too heavy.’ The literature of the
                        masses “mast be diversified with headlines and salted with sensationalism’ ;
                        it ‘must appeal to the uppermost prejudices of the moment,’ offer ‘a diurnal
                        repast of blood- shed,’ ‘ maintain itself by the athletic’ and sporting
                        news, which in the main sells the papers in the streets.’ ‘No social
                        revolution,’ he concludes, ‘will come from a people so absorbed in cricket
                        and. football.</p>

                    <p>(Gazette's Special Service.)</p>
                    <p>London, Wednesday.</p>
                    <p>Sir Lewis Morris is dead.</p>
                    <p>Sir Lewis Morris, whose death is reported above, was born in Carmarthen, in
                        January, 1838, being the eldest son of the late LE. Williams Morris, of
                        Carmarthen, formerly of Blannant, Breconshire, by Sophia, daughter of the
                        late John Hughes, of Carmarthen. He was educated at Cowbridge, and Sherborne
                        Schools and Jesus College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1855 as first class
                        in Classics and Chan- cellor’s Prizeman ; M.A., 1858; was called to the Bar
                        at Lincoln's Inn in Nov., 1861, when he obtained a Certificate of Honour of
                        the First Class ; practised chiefly as a conveyano- ing counsel until 1880 ;
                        was elected an Honor- ary Fellow of Jesus College in 1877. In 1879 he was
                        appointed a Knight of the Order of the Saviour (of Greece). In the same year
                        he ac- cepted the office of Honorary Secretary of the University College of
                        Wales, of which he was afterwards Treasurer. In 1880, he was appoint ed on
                        the Departmental Committee, charged by the Government to inquire into
                        Interme- diate and Higher Education in Wales, and, ‘in the same year, was
                        made a Justice of the Peacé for Carmarthenshire. He was appoint ed
                        Vice-Chairman ‘of the Political Committee of the Reform Club, in the place
                        of the late Mr. W.P. Adam, M.P.; and was a candidate, in December, 1881, for
                        the Carmarthen burghs but retired ; in 1886, he was Gladstonian can- didate
                        for Pembroke ard Haverfordwest, but was defeated. In 1891, on the retirement
                        of Sir C. Stepney, he was again a candidate for his native borough, but
                        retired at the request of Mr. Gladstone, in order not to endanger the seat,
                        after which he renounced all connection with, politics. Sir Lewis Morris,
                        who is also the’ author of numerous addresses and papers on educational
                        subjects, especially on the University of Wales, of which he was one of the
                        earliest advocates, and isa member of the Governing Bodies of the three
                        Welsh colleges, is perhaps best known for his contributions to the poetical
                        literatare | of the time. In 1871-74-75, appeared the: 3 | vols. of “Songs
                        of Two Worlds,” since collect ed, 28rd edition, In 1876 appeared Book IL,
                        and in 1877, Books I. and IIL, of “Epic of Hades,” now in a 37th edition. In
                        December 1878, appeared “Gwen, a Drama, in Monologue,” in March, 1880, “The
                        Ode of Life,” both which are since in a 17th edition, and in Oct., 1883,
                        “Songs Unsung,” since in a 15th edition. In 1886, appeared a tragedy,
                        “Gycia,” now in a 14th edition, and in 1887,» “Songs of Britain,” now in a
                        12th edition, embodying several beautiful Welsh legends, and containing also
                        the Odes on the Queen’s Jubilee, and on the foundation of the Imperial
                        Institute (the latter written, by request, owing to the illness of the
                        Laureate); for which Sir Lewis received the Jubilee Medal from the Queen.
                        The above works are now collected, and were published under the author's
                        name, in a popular edition of one volume in the spring of 1890 ; which
                        volume has passed into a ninth edition in October, 1890, Sir Lewis published
                        his poem “A Vision of Saints,” which, proceeding after the manner of Dante,
                        attempts for the Chris tian ideal what “The Epic of Hades” did for that of
                        the Pagan world. Sir Lewis wrote in 1892 another tragedy from Byzantine
                        history The Odes on the Death of the Duke of Clarence, on the opening of the
                        Imperial Institute, and on the Royal. Marriage, are from his peri, and the
                        last two were written by desire. Sir Lewis is the great-grandson of the
                        well-known Welsh antiquary and poet, Lewis Morris, of Penbryn, in
                        Cardiganshire.</p>

                    <head>“DAILY NEWS” AND KAMEL.</head>
                    <p>The “Daily News” has given Mustapha his puff direct and the “Egyptian
                        Standard” and its French fellow invalid point the obvious moral, and will
                        doubtless adorn the tale as they have adorned Lord Cromer’s speech with
                        garlands of misreading. His Lordship accord- ing to the leader writer of the
                        “Standard” threatened.the Egyptian Nationalists with the heavy hand were
                        they to overstep the law. As a matter of fact he addressed himself to the
                        extremists and only had good words for moderate men: but what are facts to
                        Mustapha? They shrivel, like cobwebs in the fire, under the glow of his
                        imagination and their ashes are used for blackening purposes. If you
                        disagree, what about the doubts cast upon Lord Cromer’s “yarns” to use the
                        “Egyptian Standard’s” elegant phrase ' The story of doctor and the maniac is
                        well known. The Murison, a well known and respected profes sional man,
                        vouches for its authencity. He was as a matter of fact the victim of the
                        maniac’s onslaught and the apathy of the shawishes present, and it was, I
                        believe, with no Tittle diffeulty that he mastered his assailant, unaided by
                        the immovable witness of the affair. Perhaps, however, we are wronging
                        Mustapha and should lay the blame on his industrious Editors whose ignorance
                        of Egypt has never checked their dogmatism on all ques- tions Egyptian. Did
                        not one of them, three or four months after his arrival in the country, sign
                        his name to an article entitled “Lord Cromer and Moslem Theology.” The
                        fabled ‘Teuton who evolved a camel from his inner conscious ness scarcely
                        showed more daring than the modest possessor of an ample share of the
                        “perfervidum ingebiom Hibernorum.” Toretorn to the “Daily News,” that
                        estimable but viewy journal published some time back an article penned by
                        Mr. Wilfred Scawen Blunt, who, after telling us what a fine young fellow
                        Mustapha Kamel was, expressed his conviction that he would find it possible
                        to work with Sir Eldon Gorst. In this connection | mast relate a fable
                        entitled “The Valture and the Parasite,” the original Jagatai version of
                        which was disvovered, either by Dr. Sven Hedin or by another renowned
                        explorer, in the reins of Karakorum. It runs as follows :—</p>
                    <p>“A Valture perched upon the summits of the Thianshan, observed in the Plains
                        below him Clouds of Dust moving regularly from East to West. “This’, quoth
                        he, ‘portends a ast: for Caravans and Armies alone raise such a Dust in the
                        Desert.’ With these words the sagacious Fowl launched himself into the Air,
                        accompanied by a Parasite who desiring to abide with his Host clang to his
                        left side by means of his Mandibles. “What is biting me!” said the Vulture
                        as he flew. ~“Paster, aster” replied the Parasite. “I am urging you forward
                        for good.” “Quite so” answered the Raptorial nor did he say more until he
                        had lighted upon the Carcase of a Bactrian Camel and heard his Companion
                        exclaim “Observe the Value of my Advice! Fall to, Devour the Camel and
                        invigorate your Blood which, | warn you, has become impoverished of late.
                        Exactly’ quoth his Host ‘but I most first preen my Plomage’. With this he
                        thrust his head below his ‘eft Wing and seized the Coun sellor with his
                        Beak. ‘What is this’ quoth the Insect—‘will you destroy one who urged you to
                        the Banquet ? ‘| hold a different Opinion’ as*to the Value of your
                        Co-operation’ quoth the Vulture as he dashed the Parasite against a
                        Brick.</p>
                    <p>Exeuse this disgression and return with the writer to the “Daily News.” What
                        wonder that moderation is not believed to pay when a journal of some
                        importance takes up the extremist or ex-extremists and dubs him ‘the first
                        journalist of the Moslem world.’ . We should have thought that the able
                        Indian Moslems who ‘contribute to the British and Indian Press might have
                        something to say to this appreciation but then men like ~the “Aga Khan,”
                        Syed Amir Ali and the rest have not indulged in agitation or favoured
                        talumny, which doubtless militates against them as far as the “Daily News”
                        is concerned. A question now arises, ‘How will the Egypt ian Committee take

                        monopolist—at least, he said he did, though there are semé who aver that he
                        had speech with him twiee or thrice—and thoagh he met him at meetings and
                        banquets in England, Mustapha's urro gance is said to have flicked the
                        Tyne-siler on the raw. Dr. Rutherford is expected soon, also, say some, Mr.

                    <p>Nicosia, November 1.</p>
                    <p>A pleasant little ceremony took place in Larnaca ‘last month, when Mr. W. J.
                        Ansell, Collector of Customs, and at the time acting as Commissioner of the
                        District, was invested with the Imperial Service Order. This Order is given
                        for long and meritorious service under the Government and it is generally
                        felt that the selection of Mr. Ansell for this distinction was a very
                        judicious one, He has been a valuable official of the Cypras Govern- ment
                        almost from the date ot the British Occupation and during the whole time of
                        his long service he has devoted himself with much zeal and ability to the
                        work he has had to perform. His Excellency the High Commissioner came from
                        Nicosia on purpose to present the decoration tad Colonel Gore, Chief
                        Collector of Castoms also was present, and the occasion was regarded by the
                        trading officials and re- sidents of the District and town of Larnaca as a
                        great event, and they attended the ceremony in large numbers as a mark of
                        their appre- ciation of the honour done to Mr. Ansell.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglas King Harman, who has been suffering from typhoid fever is now
                        conva- lescent and has left the hospital at Nicosia and is with his parents
                        at Government House.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Heidenstam, C. M. G. is also recovering from the seizure he had a
                        fortnight ago, and is now able to leave his room.</p>
                    <p>The promotion is announced of Mr. F. H. Parker, District Judge of Nicosia to
                        the post of Puisne Judge of the Leeward Islands. Mr. Parker has had a
                        service of 17 years in the Island and throughout this long period he has
                        earned a high reputation for judicial wisdom and legal ability. A farewell
                        dinner is to be given him on the 24th inst. by’ members of the English Club
                        at Nicosia, of which he has for some time been Honorary Secretary. His
                        Excellency the High Commissioner has promised to attend the dinner. Mr
                        Parker will be greatly missed at the Club, the affairs of which he has so
                        well managed, and the welfare of which has been with him an object of
                        constant solicitude Among Freemasons also his depar- ture will be greatly
                        regretted, as he has for long been known as a zealous member of the
                        craft.</p>
                    <p>Interest is naturally aroused in the local official world by the statements
                        in the press regarding Mr. Winston Charchill’s advocacy of the claims of
                        Cyprus Civil Servants to in creased rates of pay. That the present salaries
                        are mostly quite inadequate seems now to be generally admitted, and the
                        matter was pro- minently brought before Mr. Churchill's notice when
                        here.</p>
                    <p>The announcement in the English press, that T.R.H, The Duke and Dachess of
                        Connaught will reside in Cyprus for a certain period of each year, has given
                        the utmost satisfaction, and more definite news is now eagerly awaited.</p>

                        line suffered sone damage. Two men in the Larnaca District are reported to

                        ages was in very_ high repute and huge exports were regularly made, and it
                        has been for some time under considera tion whether this trade might not be

                    <head>THE SITUATION IN ASIA MINOR.</head>
                    <head>(THROUGH REUTERS’ AGENCY).</head>
                    <p>Constantinople, November 6.</p>
                    <p>The discontent among the Moslem popula- tion of Erzerous has brought about a
                        situation which much resembles that prevailing in many of the more important
                        towns in Persia where the reins of local government has been assumed by
                        administrative committees. As a sequel to the recent bread riots in Erzerous
                        a committee was constituted among the Moslem notables to fix the price of
                        bread, floor and other articles of necessity, so as to prevent any attempts
                        at corners. This committee has gradually increased its scope and is now
                        look- ed to by the population.tor guidance in all matters. Taxes are paid or
                        not paid accord- ing asthe committee may direct, and muni- cipal affairs are
                        subjected to its general supervision. In Persian towns where such local
                        doumas have been established the Governor and other officials appointed by
                        the Shah have either been completely ignored or driven away, but in Erzeroun
                        the Vali and his subordinates continue to have charge of the actual
                        administration. These latter have hitherto not made any serious efforts to
                        resist the growing powers of the committee owing to the spirit of unity and
                        independence shown on previous occasions by the population. As the troops
                        quartered in Erzeroum have hitherto always sided with the people the
                        authorities lately attempted to change the garrison but demonstrations by
                        the Moslem mob induced them to abandon or postpone this plan.</p>
                    <p>There appeats to have been considerable unrest among the Kardish tribes in
                        Kharpont, Van and Bitlis. Owing to the general distress to which their
                        improvident habits expose them very severely, they have been compelled to
                        show unusual activity in plundering their slightly better-off Christian and
                        Turkish neigh- bours,</p>
                    <p>The authorities do not usually show much concern when the Kurds confine their
                        atten: tions to Armenians who are regarded more or less as their natural
                        prey, but the frequent attacks on Tarkish villages bave rowsed them to a
                        sense of the gravity of the. situation. Instructions have been sent to the
                        Valis to show more energy in their treatment of the Kurds with a view to
                        curbing their lawlessness and some of the provincial authorities are acting
                        in the spint of these instructions. At Bitlis a force of soldiers was sent
                        aghinst a village belénging to a Kurtlish chief whose deprecations have been
                        a‘ constant source of trouble and distress in that neighbotrhood, The
                        village was destroyed and a quantity of stolen articles recovered. Examples
                        of such retribative action of the part of the Govern- ment aré unfortunately
                        rare, and in some districts of Kharbout and Van the Kurds seem to be masters
                        of the sitaation. This is parti- cularly the case in the Dersim district
                        where Turkish authority has never been very firmly established. Several
                        Embassies have drawn the attention of the Porte to the situation in these
                        provinces and have recommended the adoption of measures to prevent any
                        serious outbreak.</p>
