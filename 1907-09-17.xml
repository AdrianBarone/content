                    <head>OCCIDENT v. ORIENT.</head>
                    <p> | The anti-Asiatic riots in the United States have suddenly assumed a shape
                        which affects Great Britain far more seriously than did those of a few
                        months ago. In the case of the anti Japanese agitation, our interest was
                        only contingent; in that of the anti-Hindoo agitation which has just
                        culminated in rioting at Bellingham, our interest is direct and unavoid
                        able. A Hindoo is as much a British subject as an Englishman or Sootsman;
                        whatever affects him injuriously in foreign countries is as much the concern
                        of the British Government as if it offected injurioasly a man born in the
                        British Isles instead of India. It is, therefore, a matter of peculiar
                        importance to the Empire when the anti-Asiatie feeling in the West of
                        America turns against the comparatively few Hindoos who dwell in the small
                        frontier town near the northern boundary of the State of Washington. It
                        seeins probable that the Indian Colony there is a relio of the unfortunate
                        emigration movement which drew a </p>
                    <p> number of Indians to Canada some time ago. When they found that the climate
                        was too severe for them, many, if not most, of the Indians went home of
                        their own accord or had their passages paid for them; some, however, seem to
                        have settled on the Pacifie slope. They were probably quiet and inoffensive,
                        but industrious. At any rate, no credence need be given to the report spread
                        by the anti-Asiatic agitators that white women were pashed into gutters and
                        insalted on street-cars. A small community of new-comers, living
                        precariously on sufferance in a foreign land, do not generally go out of
                        their way to draw down the wrath of their hosts, and risk a possible
                        lynching and certain banishment by attacking those who outnumber them by
                        thousands to one. </p>
                    <p> - It so happens that the City Cogncil of Bellingham have acted in an
                        unexpectedly creditable manner, in comparison with the course pursued by the
                        Corporation of San Francisco. They have sworn in special officers to protect
                        the strangers within their gates; but those strangers are already leaving
                        for Vancouver. In British territory the Asiatic may not always be very
                        welcome ; bat life, limb, and property are secure. It remains to be seen,
                        however, whether the incident will end in this fashion. The feeling against
                        the Orientals is still simmering in the Occident; it may boil over again at
                        any moment. The Federal Government may profess themselves to be powerless to
                        deal with a recaloitrant State in this matter; and ansatisfactory though
                        that ples may be, it is not to be denied that the Americans can answer any
                        protest which the British Government may make by a very effective "ta
                        quoque." Much the same constitutional situation occurs in the British
                        Empire, and the Imperial Government finds itself powerless to take any
                        effective measures. Neither in Australia nor in South Africa are Asiatics
                        desired, and small distinction is drawn in those Bountries under the Union
                        Jack between Asiatics who are British subjects and Asia tios who are not. In
                        both the colour bar is more power ful than the pass of Imperial citizenship.
                        The Natal Restriction Act, for instance, which has become the foundation of
                        all the Colonial exclusion laws now in force, does not specifically exclude
                        Asiaties; it simply forbids the entry into the Colony of paupers or persons
                        likely to become a public charge, idiots lunatios, diseased, immoral and
                        criminal persons, and anybody who, when asked, fails to write in some
                        European language application for admission to the Colony. </p>
                    <p> For all practical purposes such an Act hardly operates against any but
                        Asiaties. And it is probably small consolation to the Hindoo to remember
                        that he is exeluded from a British Colony, not as a British subject, but as
                        an undesirable person whom the low places in the same category as lunatics
                        and criminals. The poll-tax which prevails in other places is a more direct
                        means of attaining the same end. The Asiatic is given to understand that he
                        is not wanted in British Colonies; and this operates especially in countries
                        where a white population rules an aboriginal coloured race. Here again, it
                        is not very comforting to the civilised emigrant from India, who prides
                        himself on his ancestors and on being a British subject, to remember that he
                        is classed with the Kaffir or with those dying tribes of Australia which
                        have not even a distinctive name of their own. The British Government have
                        protested in the past against such exelusion laws, and have vetoed some of
                        them on occasion; but neither their protest nor their veto has been of any
                        effect. A sel-governing State of the Ernpire has, in practice, the power to
                        say whom it will accept or refuse within its borders; and the admittedly
                        impotent attitude of Lord Elgin in the latest case of British Indians in the
                        Transvaal only tells again an oft-told tale. In these circumstances, it may
                        be imagined how little force any representations from Mr. Bryce will have at
                        Washington. The whole question of racial competition is of such appalling
                        difficulty and complexity that one can do little more at present than grope
                        towards a tentative solution, and deprecate any such inflammatory tactics as
                        have been pursued on the Pacific slope of the United States. A definite
                        issue is raised; unhappily, no definite answer can yet be given. </p>

                            water, and immediately after drinking the same he fell down in a fit and

                        <p> Yesterday at about 3 p.m a tram ran into a Tanzim automobile, in the rue
                            Vieux Caire which was leaving the Public Works building. The chauffeur
                            escaped uninjured, but the motor was completely destroyed. A delay of 35

                    <div type="subsection">
                        <head>THE NILE SUPPLY AND SEASON</head>
                        <p> In his report upon the irrigation service in Egypt and the Sudan for the
                            year 1906 Sir William Garstin says : </p>
                        <p>The year 1906 showed a decided improvement, as regards river discharges,
                            over its immediate predecessors. For seven years previous, the levels
                            throughout the year had been persistently below the average, and in one
                            case the river in summer fell to a point lower than any that had
                            previously been recorded. Last year the maximum height registered was
                            that of an average, but not of a good flood. At the end of 1905 the
                            prospects for the following season were far from satisfactory, as the
                            gauge readings at Wadi Halfa averaged some 40 centimetres below the
                            normal river-level for that period of the year. Everything seemed to
                            point to a continuance of the conditions that had so long ruled, and to
                            indicate another year of poor supply. Early and abnormal rains, however,
                            in the months of February and March brought a timely supply down the
                            Blue Nile, apd materially changed the aspect of affairs -- converting
                            what must otherwise have been a bad summer into a good one.</p>
                        <p> On May the 1st the Blue Nile at Roseires stood 1.13 metres above the
                            average of previous years, and about this time the Sobat commenced to
                            rise. Throughout the month in question the increase in both rivers was
                            insig. nificant, but in June the levels of the Blue Nile rose rapidly.
                            The rise in the Sobat also continued, but at a normal rate. These
                            increases in the south did not, however, produce a similar effect in the
                            north. From the commencement of May the river-levels at Wadi Halfa
                            commenced to fall. This drop continued until the middle of June, when
                            the effect of the annual steady rise began to make itself apparent. This
                            rise, therefore, as regards Egypt was a late one, and until the middle
                            of July was very slow. Subsequent to this last date, the increase was
                            normal, and the rise of the river was continuous until the 18th of Sep
                            tember, when the maximum height of 15 pics 20 kirats was registered upon
                            the Aswan gauge. The fall of the river was also normal, and at the end
                            of 1906 the levels at Wadi-Halfa were better than had been the case, at
                            that season, in any one of the seven preceding years. Mr. Webb describes
                            the measures taken for ensuring the effective distribution of water
                            throughout the year, so I will not further allude to them. I must,
                            however, say some thing about the effective manner in which he, and his
                            staff, regulated and controlled the water stored in the Aswan Reservoir.

                        <head>THE NILE RESERVOIR</head>
                        <p> The regulation of the dam sluices is a most intricate business,
                            demanding continual care and study of the river to the south. The
                            sluices last year were so skilfully manipulated that the levels of the
                            river downstream of the dam mere steadily increased, as the summer
                            advaneed, so as to correspond with and meet the increase in the demand
                            for water in the north. The daily amount added to the river from the
                            reservoir varied from six to twenty millions of cubic metres. It is
                            difficult to speak too highly of the work here done by Mr. Maodonald,
                            and his assistant, Mr. Cooper. Throughout the summer months, thanks to
                            their labours, as the demand in Egypt increased, there was always more
                            water forthcoming with which to meet it. Until the period of severe
                            pressure (which occurs annually in July, just before the arrival of the
                            flood) arose, water was plentiful every where, and the distribution gave
                            but little tronble. </p>

                    <p>We regret to record the death of Mr. T.W. Denman, J.P., which occurred
                        recently at Retford, and we offer to his family and relations our sincere
                        condolences. The Denman family, of wbom members have been residents in Egypt
                        for several years, have been land owners in West and East Retford and neigh.
                        bourhood for some hundred years. One of the family, Nicolas Denman of East
                        Retford - whose old timbered house stood on or near the side of the national
                        infants school, Grove Street, for about 300 years-married secondly Anne,
                        daughter of Humphrey Herey, Esq. and sister of Sir John Hercy, Grove Hall,
                        who at her brother's death, succeeded to the manor of West Retford, where
                        they afterwards resided Her descendant was Anne Denman, who it is stated was
                        the grandmother of two Queens of England —Queen Mary II and Queen Annewhile
                        her sister Barbara married Edward Darrel Esq., of Horkstowe Manor,
                        Lincolnshire.</p>
                    <p>Of their five sons the youngest and sole survivor was John Darrel, B.A.,
                        M.D., who dying childless, founded the noble charity of the Holy Trinity,
                        West Retford. Thus Mr. Thomas William Denman was a collateral descendant of
                        the original Dennan family as well as of the founder of the above named
                        institution. Mr. Denman was proprietor in West Retford of some of the
                        original lands, which were descended from his ancestor. He acted as
                        solicitor to the Trinity "Hospital estate, and clerk to the Church and Poor

                        <p> Many other things have contributed to the sound economic condition of
                            Egypt. The adjective "economio” implies not merely that which pertains
                            to the regulation of a country's management, but denotes equally freedom
                            from wastefulness and extravagance. I need not dwell on the regularity
                            and the reforms introduced, for they are known to all who have followed
                            Lord Cromer's brilliant carcor, nor need I refer in great detail to the
                            excellence of the financial system now. 80 firmly establis. hed, yet it
                            is useful to point out that the latest Trade and Customs retums show a
                            higher total than any ever previously attained, the total value of
                            merchandise imported and exported in 1906 amounting to £48,888,000, as
                            against less than half that sum in 1896. The revenue of Egypt has
                            Nkewise steadily expanded - during the last five years at an average
                            annual rate of £553,900 from £9,675,000 in 1887 to £15,374,000 in 1906.
                            There is as well a sum of over elever millions sterling standing to the
                            credit of the reserve fund, while the total amount of the Egyptian debt
                            now in the hands of the public is but £87,416,000, and the interest
                            charge borne by the taxpayers but £3,368,000, as compared with
                            £96,457,000 and £4,268,000 in 1883, when the British first occupied the
                            country and began their beneficent work of reform. And this result has
                            been achieved notwithstanding progressive and very considerable
                            reductions in taxation. It is noteworthy also that with the country's
                            prosperity the population has increased from 6,814,000 in 1882 to
                            9,734,000 in 1897 (the date of the last census), and that it now
                            approximates in the Delta provinces to 650 inhabitants to every square
                            mile, or donble the estimated density of population in the United
                            Kingdom. Labour is consequently abundant and continues cheap, while the
                            Egyptian labourers are remarkable for their vigour and industry. </p>
                        <p> If in the foregoing preliminary pages I have refrained from giving
                            statistical tables in support of the several assertions of fact. I have
                            done so not because there is insufficient material from which to compile
                            them, but rather because I have desired by a simple olear and cogent
                            statement, not unduly burdened with figures, to disabuse the public mind
                            of any possibly existing, though latent, impression that the recent
                            Alexandria Bourse troubles reflect any semblance of unsoundness in the
                            State. The facts I have inarshalled should dispel once and for all any
                            lingering mists of doubt on this score, and baving thus cleared the
                            ground I will proceed to show why I hold that a golden opportunity now
                            exists in Egypt for the <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> British
                            investor, and I shall venture to indicate, quoting chapter and verse for
                            my beliefs, certain safe investments.</p>
                        <p>To the far sighted the recent Bourse troubles will appear but a blessing
                            in disguise. Not only was a larger quantity of shares placed last winter
                            on the Alexandria market than the members of the European colonies in
                            Egypt could absorb, but practically no assistance was forthcoming from
                            the numbers of wealthy natives, for these gentlemen limit themselves
                            almost entirely, when they do invest their sav. ings, to the purchase of
                            agricultural lands. Not having sufficient ready-money capital, European
                            purchasers of the new shares multiplied their holdings by having
                            recourse to the old expedient of borrowing from their bankers,
                            depositing as cover first their gilt | edged bearer securities-e.g.,
                            National, and Agricultural, Bank of Egypt shares--and final ly, as
                            collateral cover, their newly-purchased shares. Seeing that the spirit
                            of speculation was abroad, and that the concurrent and extraordinary
                            boom in building plots must sooner or later, bring disaster to many, the
                            principal Banks were at first chary of lending any but nominal sums on
                            shares in the new companies, and finally refused altogether to lend
                            anything at all on them. Driven into a corner when a few local failures
                            caused the speculative bubble to burst, operators were not only
                            frequently unable to pay off their loans, or provide fresh marginal
                            cover, but in many cases found them selves saddled with lines of new
                            shares (to say nothing of building lands)which had becomeprao tically,
                            though but temporarily, unmarketable Thus they were constrained to allow
                            the Banks to protect themselves by selling the securities deposited with
                            them as guarantee for advances and, as sound shares like those of the
                            National Bank of Egypt and of the Agricultural Bank were chief among the
                            securities readily saleable, the consequence was that these highclass
                            shares were thrown in large numbers on The market, with the inevitable
                            result that National Banks tell from 281, at which figure they stood at
                            the beginning of the present year to below £17, while Agrionltural Banks
                            nenoted from £10 to 77. And it is noteworthy that the fall was
                            aggravated by many of the shares be ing sold in Paris at the time when
                            that Bourse was already depressed on account of the serious disturbances
                            among the wine-growers in the extreme south of France. The financial
                            position in Egypt thus became almost unique scarcity (of money) in the
                            midst of plentywondrons prosperity and yet dearth of funds. <hi

                            on Friday afternoon. The Incapables were suitably led by Mt. H. P.

                            the Incompetents op Mr. Leslie Reid. The Inanpa bles won the toss and
                            made bat a fooble display until the arrival of Carver Bros, who made the
                            ball spin as merrily as they usually do the cotton, until finally canght

                            succeeded in all but putting matters on an even keel, Mr. Barand gave an
                            astonishing ly dashing display to the tone of 61 compiled in less than

                                ill-considered propositions in order to impress an uninstructed
                                public. It cites the case of the Prize Court and says that the
                                reason for which Russia and Japan provisionally withheld their
                                assent was weighty. It urges that England should follow the example
                                of her sagacious ally Japan and take time to minutely study the
                                Prize Court scheme before committing herself. <hi rend="italic"

                    <head>THE LEBANON EXPERIMENT</head>
                    <p> The special correspondent to the Times" writes from Beyrout as
                        follows:--</p>
                    <p>The nomination of Yusuf Pasha to the Governorship of the Lebanon has not been
                        received with any great enthusiasm in "the Mountain." The fear that the new
                        Governor wonld follow the pro-elerical policy of his father, Franco Nasri
                        Pasha, who governed the Lebanon from 1868 to 1873, had already provoked a
                        demonstration of over 1,500 anti-clericals from the Maronite district of
                        Kesrawan, with a few Druses who, on July 3, appeared in Beirut, and begged
                        the Vali to transmit a petition to the Porte protesting against his
                        appointment. It is quite possible that the petition never reached the Porte;
                        but, however vain their protest, the anti-clericals of what was till
                        recently the most bigoted district in the Maronite territory had at least
                        the satisfaction of showing Beirut that their strength, sedulously minimized
                        by the clergy, was numerically greater than their opponents had dared to
                        admit. Other sections of the population regarded with some anxiety. the
                        appointment of the son of a former Governor, connected by marriage with
                        Naoum Pasha, who preceded the late Muzaffer Pasha as Governor of the
                        province, arguing that the new Mutesarrif was not unlikely to be influenced
                        by the supporters of his father and Naonm Pasha in the appointment and
                        dismissal of functionaries, from the point of view of the numerous
                        placehunters of the Lebanon, the most important of the prerogatives of the
                        Governor of "the Mountain." </p>
                    <p> The future will show how far these apprehensions are well grounded ;
                        meanwhile Yusuf Pasha will require greater abilities than those with which
                        he is credited, even by his supporters, if he is to make a firm stand
                        against the intrigues of families and factions and the growth of political
                        corruption, which proved too strong for his predecessor. For Muzaffer
                        Pasha's administration this much may be claimed---namely, that it equitably
                        maintained the balance between the various religious secta, each of which
                        was, and is, only too ready to take offence at the slightest encroachment,
                        real or fancied, on its rights as guaranteed by the Organic Law of 1861.
                        Otherwise, it was unsuccessful ; Liberal views and good intentions, personal
                        integrity, tact, and kindliness could not atone for the fatal weakness of
                        will that made the late Governor the pappet of intrigues local, Consular,
                        and domestic and disappointed all who had believed that his early promises
                        of administrative reform would be carried into effect. But whatever may have
                        been urged against Muzaffer Pasha's administation, what ever may be urged in
                        the future against that of Yusuf Pasha, it must be admitted that the
                        position of the Governor of the Lebanon has become far from enviable.
                        Though, perhaps, the most independent of Ottoman officials during his term
                        of office, he is none the less compelled, in view of his eventual return to
                        Constantinople, to avoid all action that may ruffle the susceptibilities or
                        arouse the suspicions of the Sultan. The Great Powers of Europe' through
                        their representatives at Beirut and Constantinople, take a more or less
                        active interest in bis administration ; religious rival ries, the intrigues
                        of local notables and of the administrative council, an antiquated
                        Constitution, and an illogical system of local finance hamper his every
                        action. He is, in short, condemned to carry out a most difficult task with
                        the aid of obsolete machinery and with the certainty of interference from
                        without and within. </p>
                    <p> It may be urged that this is a somewhat cavalier criticism of the results of
                        the experiment of 1860, that since the interference of Europe the Lebanon
                        has enjoyed complete immunity from the disturbances that are endemic in
                        other provinces of the Ottoman Empire, that the Lebanese are themselves
                        mainly to blame for the growing disorganization of the administration, or
                        that, given a strong Governor of the type of Rustem Pasha, all would once
                        more go well in the Mountain." Before reply. ing to these objections it is
                        necessary to give a brief sketch of the physical and social condi. tions of
                        the province, as far as they have any bearing upon local politics, and of
                        its Con stitution according to the modified Organic Law ot 1864. </p>
                    <p> “THE MOUNTAIN” AND ITS PEOPLE</p>
                    <p>The province of Lebanon, as defined by the protocols of 1861 and 1864, is not
                        contermin ons with the mountain range of that name. It may be roughly
                        described as a strip of mount ainous country, bounded on the east by the
                        watershed and on the west by the Mediterra nean, averaging some 25 miles in
                        breadth, and extending some 40 miles north ard 80 miles south of Beirut,
                        which, with the towns of Tripoli and Sidon, is under direct Ottoman
                        administration. On the eastern slope of the central range of the Lebanon the
                        town and part of the district of Zahleh belong to the province, as does the
                        isolated village of Hurmil, 30 miles northwest of Baalbeck. Except in the
                        neighbour hood of Beirut and in part of the district of Kūra immediately
                        south of Tripoli, the country is simply a succession of stony ridges,
                        projecting westward like ribs from the backbone of the central chain and
                        separated from one another by deep and often precipitous ravines. Save in
                        the low-lying areas that have been mentioned, the country is naturally
                        little suited to agriculture, the whole of the corn crop, planted in the
                        stoniest of soils, being insufficient to supply the needs of the population
                        of the province for three months. The plodding industry of the pesants has
                        covered the billsides with terraces, on which mulberries, vines, and a few
                        other fruits are grown, and sericulture is now the principal, and in many
                        districts almost the only, occapation of the people, the bulk of the
                        ooooons, waste silk, and </p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p> silk thread exported, to the amount of nearly 25,000 bales during the last
                        three years, from Beirut and Tripoli coming from the Lebanon villagos. Some
                        20 silk spinning mills, few of which employ more than 60 persons, are at
                        work mainly in the central districts of the province. Vines are very
                        generally grown, and some very good wine is manufactured in the
                        neighbourhood of Zahleh. Sheep and goats are fairly numerous, and the latter
                        most destructive to the soanty remnants of the forests which once covered
                        the mountains. Minerals may exist in paying quantities within certain areas,
                        but on this point nothing appears to be definitely known. </p>
                    <p> The whole configuration of the country makes for political disunion. A
                        village is often nearly a day's journey from its vis-à-vis on the next ridge
                        or on the next but one, only four or five miles away as the crow flies, bat
                        separated by precipitous gorges hundreds of feet deep, and perhaps eight or
                        ten miles in length. Religion, here as elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, the
                        principal cause of political division, has aided nature in accentuating the
                        differences between the various sections of what seems to have been
                        originally a fairly homogeneous population. There are certainly two or three
                        general racial types that may be found, at times in the same family, all
                        over Syria; but it is equally certain that some Europeans and many natives
                        who possess a thorough knowledge of the country and its people can usually
                        distinguish between a Maronite and a Greek Catholic, a Moslem and a Druse.
                        The majority of the religions and sects of Syria are represented in "the
                        Mountain." Isolated groups of Moslems, both Sannis and Metwali Sbiabs, with
                        a few mountain Beduin, occur in the southern district of Shaf, Dear Zahleh,
                        and in Kesrawan, while isolated Hormil is mainly inhabited by Metwalis. Shof
                        is the centre of the Lebanon Druses, who are also represented in the central
                        district of Metn and in Jezzin in the extreme south. To turn to the
                        Christian sects, the northern districts, with the im portant exception of
                        Kura, &amp; Greek Orthodox stronghold, are almost entirely inhabited by
                        Maronites, Zahleh is predominantly Greek Catholic, and in the southern
                        provinces the sects are mixed, the Maronites being rather more numerous than
                        the Orthodox Greeks, while small groups of Protestants occur bere and there,
                        usually in the neighbourhood of mission stations. No census having been
                        taken since 1862, it impossible to give more than an approximate estimate of
                        the present population of the province. According to the best-informed
                        autborities, tbe Maronites number about 220,000, the Druses 60,000, and the
                        Orthodox Greeks some 45,000, the balance of from 60.000 to 70,000 souls
                        being mainly composed of Greek Catholics and Sunni and Metwali Moslems, </p>
                    <p> Like most mountaineers, the peasants, who constitute the great majority of
                        the population, are a decidedly attractive race. Physically strong,
                        well-made, and often good looking, they are mentally a shrewd, sharp-witted
                        folk, with an intelligence that is more Buropean-that is, more ratiocinative
                        and controlled to a greater extent by conscious logical processes-than that
                        of the average uneducated or half-educat ed Egyptian, whose pind never seems
                        to have room for more than a few fixed quasi-instinctive ideas wbich he may
                        attempt to defend, but at which he seldom seems to arrive, with the aid of
                        reason. Politically unstable and inclined to petty intrigue, as opportunist
                        as most of their neighbours, still somewhat deficient in moral courage,
                        regarding local affairs too often from &amp; sectarian or personal
                        standpoint, their civic qualities are still rudimentary, though better
                        developed than those of certain other Oriental races. In enterprise,
                        courage, self-respect, and freedom from petty crime they are far superior to
                        the Egyptian; but what most impresses the visitor from Egypt is their
                        respect for women, whose influence on the family life of the people is very
                        marked both among Christians and Druses. A girl may travel alone through the
                        most solitary districts of the Mountain" without fear of harm, and per
                        contra the sight of a laden woman staggering along in the dost behind her
                        lord, who rides comfortably on an ass, common enough in the Nile Valley, is
                        extremely rare, if not unknown, among the Lebanese. </p>
                    <p> It would be tedious and unprofitable to describe the civil war of 1860,
                        which was simply the culmination of an ancient quarrel between the
                        closely-knit Druse community led by the powerful families of Jumblat and
                        Arslan and tbe less cohesive Maronites, direct ed and often led by their
                        numerous and powerful clergy. The conflict was marked by numerous terrible
                        incidents, such as the sack of Zahleh and the massacre at Dêr el Kamar ; but
                        it may be noted that the Druses, if ruthless in battle, abstained from
                        inflicting any insult or harm on women and children, the more brutal
                        outrages that disgraced the struggle being the work of Turkish troops and of
                        bands of fanatical Moslems from the vilayets of Beirut and Damascus. The
                        civil war and the savage antiChristian ontbreaks in the vilayets caused the
                        intervention of the Powers, which resulted in granting of administrative
                        autonomy to the Lebanon. Though deprived of its natural outlets to the sea
                        and shorn of some of its most fertile areas, the new province secured the
                        inestimable advantage of being guaranteed against direct Turkish
                        interference or administration. Its constitution, as framed in the Organic
                        Law of 1861-6, its revised version of 1864, may be very briefly summarized. </p>
                    <p>The province is administered by an irremovable Christian Governor appointed
                        for a period of five years and directly dependent upon the Porte. He
                        possesses full administrative powers, save in loyal finance, is responsible
                        for the collection of taxes and the maintence of public order, and the
                        appointment of administrative and executive officials, including Judges of
                        first instance and appeal. He also convokes</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p> the council known as the Mejlis el Idarah. This body is composed of 12
                        representatives of the seven administrative districts, or kaima kamliks, of
                        "the Mountain" chosen from the dominant seot or seots of each district. Thus
                        Kara is represented by an Orthodox Greek, Zahleh by a Greek Catholic, Shaf
                        by a Druse and a Moslem. The members are elected by the sheikhs of the
                        villages for a period of six years, four members retiring every two years
                        with the right to re-election. The functions of the council are consultative
                        and financial; the latter are of very considerable importance, for the
                        Mejlis el Idareh is, to all intents and purposes, an inde pendent department
                        of finance, solely responsible for the framing of the Budget, the imposition
                        of taxes, infine, for the entire control of the revenue and expenditure. In
                        financial matters its word is law, and, though Naoum Pasha shortly after his
                        appointment as Ambassador obtained the permission of the Porte and the
                        Powers to dismiss every member of the council on the ground of its improper
                        interference with elections, there are obvious reasons against the frequent
                        adoption of so drastic a measure. The administrative unit is the Nah ieh, or
                        village commune, under a sheikh elected by the inhabitants, dependent on the
                        mudirieh, or subdistrict, which is in turn dependent on the kaymakamlik, or
                        administrative district. The kaimakans are appointed by the Governor, the
                        Medjis by the Governor in theory on the recommendation of the kaimakam. The
                        electors of the Mejlis el Idareh are the sheikhs of the village communes of
                        each district, who also possess the power to try petty cases of
                        misdemeanour, &amp;c, and to impose fines not exceeding 200 piastres, their
                        judicial functions resembling those of justices of the peace. Crimes are
                        dealt with by the Courts of first instance and appeal, in which the
                        principle of representation by communities is followed in all “mixed"
                        cases--that is, cases in which the parties are of a different religion or
                        sect. </p>

                    <head>A CASE OF INTEREST TO WOMEN</head>
                    <p>15, Milier Street</p>
                    <p>Coatbridge Scotland.</p>
                    <p> It is many years ago now since I was first taken with kidney trouble. It
                        began with a dull, grinding pain in the small of my back, bat after a while
                        there were sharp, sudden pangs of pain, which nearly brought me down, and
                        these were followed by other symptoms of kidney trouble, especially gravel,
                        and great pain in passing water. </p>
                    <p> During pregnancy, the pains were much harder to bear, and just before the
                        birth of my last child there was complete stoppage, which alarmed me very
                        much. My limbs swelled up, and my eyesight was affected. I used to get such
                        pains in the head that I hardly knew what to do with myself.</p>
                    <p>Doctors and medicine alike failed to give me any relief, but at last I have
                        found help in Doan's Backache Kidney Pills. They have been &amp; real
                        blessing to me, and I will always say 80; nothing has ever given me such
                        ease. Doan's Pills have strengthened my back, and have made me feel better
                        in many ways. Indeed, I can truthfully say that by their occasional use I
                        keep in better health than I was for years before. </p>
                    <p> Some months later, Mrs. Foster said: "I was grateful for the good Doan's
                        Pills did me when I told you about it some months ago, but how much more
                        grateful I feel now that I can tell you it is a lasting cure! There has been
                        no return of my serious kidney and bladder disorders since Kidney relieved
                        me.</p>
                    <p>"It is my wish that you make this widely known, so that others suffering as I
                        used to, may know how to get well."</p>
                    <p>Such distressing symptoms as irregular action of the heart, violent, thumping
                        beats, poor circulation of the blood, cold hands and feet, strained
                        breathing, fainting fits, and dizzy spells, are generally to be traced to
                        the kidneys; seldom is there anything the matter with the heart itself, and
                        when the kidneys are cured the heart troubles also will be cured. If,
                        however these disorders are neglected, dropsical symptoms, such as puffy
                        eyes and swollen ankles and limbs, will appear, and the body will gradually
                        fill with water.</p>
