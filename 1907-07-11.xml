                            <p>THE EGYPTIAN BOOM. BY SIR R. HAMILTON LANG. ( Concluded.) All the
                                same, it is important to ascertain he causes which have created that
                                discontent d party and the grievances of which it com blains. The
                                causes are essentially human,and n some degree natural. The motto on
                                Mustapha Kamel's newspaper, The Egyptian Standard, hose first number
                                was issued in March last, is "Egypt for the Egyptians," This is a
                                catching entiment, and indicates that the aim of the arty is to get
                                rid of British guidance. It is be ery of the petulant boy, against
                                the disapline of his tutor, and in that respect is very buman, but
                                not necessarily reasonable. It ignore the fact that British guidance
                                has delivered Egypt from a system of autocratic rule which ruined
                                Egypt for the Egyptians, has developed to an andreamed of extent.
                                the natural resouroes of the country, has substituted progress for
                                stagnation and civilising, influences for barbaric ways. These
                                results are not denied by the National ist party, but its contention
                                today is that it is now able to do without its mentor and govern
                                alone. That this pretension is unfounded even impartial Egyptians
                                acknowledge. After an absence from the country of ten years, I was
                                rejoiged to observe the marked progress which the spread of
                                education is making. I saw a type of young Egyptians at the
                                Government offices, at the railway stations and steam-boat agencies,
                                well-mannered, educated, intelligent, which scarcely existed a
                                decade ago; and when I made this remark to the best informed
                                education ist in the country, he replied, "You forget that every
                                year, we have been turning out from our schools six to seven hundred
                                such young men, and in ten years that counts." I noticed that at
                                important Mediries where ten years ago British functionaries were in
                                charge, I found their place occupied, and most creditably ocupied,
                                by Peyptians. Progress is evident. Education and inocula tion from
                                hodest surroundings and good example are showing their fruits on the
                                Payptinn character. But it requires more than decade for a nation
                                which only began its education when British guidance made it
                                possible to acquire the qualities which reoder it capable of
                                self-government. The essential is that the growth in the acquisition
                                of these qualities should be gradual and continuous, and I had
                                pleasure in being satisfied that such is the case in Egypt. The
                                pretension, however, implied in the motto of the Nationalist
                                part-"Egypt for Egyptina--is prematare, and must at present be
                                declared unreasonable Of actual grievances I could hear of none
                                which justify the hostile attitude of the Nationalist party to the
                                present rígime. In the second number of Mustapha Kamel's paper, "The
                                Egyptian Standard," there is a lengthy denunciation of what is
                                called Lord Cromer's policy, qualified antiEgyptian It asserts, in
                                the first place, that "not all Egyptians have profited by the
                                apparent state of prosperity, and that misery is common among the
                                poorer classes"; in the second place, that "the Egyptians did not
                                revolt in 1889 in order to pre several millions sterling more in the
                                excbequer, but to obtain a constitution, just laws, and a national,
                                bonest, and respected goremament." It is ridiculous to talk of
                                misery among the poorer classes when wages are at least 40 per cent
                                higher than ever before. Of the revolt of 1882 the least said, the
                                better. It was its failure which brought to Egypt just laws and an
                                honest government. The article goes on to say that the same policy
                                strack down the late Menabawi Pashs, and it did not hesitate in
                                ponishing the poor fellaheen in the horrible Denshawi case, simply
                                because they had defended their property and their wives." This
                                latter is a ourious travesty of panishments inflicted for brutally
                                Assaulting British officers. As to Menshawi Pasha, rich and
                                influential, he was justly arrested and punished by a court of law
                                for mistreating a poor subordinata The article proceeds to criticise
                                the pre motion of a judge, against whom the only fault alleged is
                                that how members of the court which tried the Denshawions, the
                                dismissal of two other judges" because they were patriots." The fact
                                is, serious gries anoes there are one. The solo grievance of the
                                discontented party is that they are not in power but it would be
                                unwise to put men in power who cry for parliamentary government
                                before the country is educated up to it to who declare themselves
                                hostile to a regime which has made the country prosperous, in which
                                administers even-handed justice to small and great. Discontent
                                springing from intentional ambitions requires only a firm and jus
                                hand to deal with it. With the freedom, pe haps too. grost, allowed
                                to the Preseth noise of the discontented is out of all proportion to
                                their importance, but, however irritation the noise may be, it need
                                ones no serion alarm. Our duty is steadfastly to pursue firm, jast,
                                and strong policy, having only i view the true interests, moral and
                                material of Egypt. Such, undoubtedly, was the policy of Lord Cromer,
                                and it was the secret of his great success It would have been
                                agreeable to me tu describe in detail the impressions produced gpon
                                my mind by my visit to Khartoum. Simply marvellous are the results
                                which in for short years have been achieved in the Anglo-Egyptian
                                territory of the Sudan, in area equal to a fourth of Europe) by the
                                able and energetic administration of Sir Reginak Wingate and his
                                coadjutors. Immenso also the future prospects of that last region,
                                over which, after years of darkness, the light of civilisation is
                                now drawing. Bat my space will not admit of my entering upon such a
                                largo, and interesting field. It is besides unconnected with the
                                subject of this article The Egyptian Boom," a remarkable wave of

                                    stock of buses as their old motor buses were not found suitable

                                    decide to call in the capital so as to make the shares fully
                                    paid up. Up to now £2 of the £4 have only been paid. Probably
                                    both these decisions will be voted and then the company will

                                    at Alexandria is the continued need of repairs. The company

                                residence 17 Rosetta-street, Alexandria. Mr. Campos was in his usual
                                health up to last Saturday when an abscess gathered in his throat to
                                which he succumbed. Mr. Campos arrived in Egypt in 1854 and was
                                among the first Alexandrian cotton operators. He was a courteous and
                                genial old gentleman and his death will be regretted by a large
                                number of friends among all classes of society in Egypt. He was over
                                seventy years of age. As a mark of sympathy the Alexandria Bourse

                                two sons, Mr. Alfred and Mr. Benvenuto Campos, in their bereavement.
                                The funeral will leave the residence of the deceased, 17 Rosetta

                            <p>"A Cairo correspondent writes -</p>
                            <p>Complaints against the Cairo City Police are very frequent and
                                although in many cases reasonable grounds of complaint are produced,
                                yet complainants are frequently ignorant of the real facts of the
                                case. For example: it is a well known fact, or should be, that the
                                Cairo City Police are very much understaffed ; not on paper, but for
                                practical purposes, and great deal, in fact by far the larger part
                                of the capital 18 patrolled by ghaflirs owing to the shortness of
                                the uniformed staff. The explanation is not very difficult to find.
                                A very large number of uniformed staff are on duty at banks and
                                other public institutions. In fact the public would be surprised to
                                know the actual percentage of the public forces soconded in this
                                manner. Consequently the police are subjected to all sorts of
                                criticism from individuals who do not know the real facts.</p>

                                        <p>The Khedive's line, which is advancing gradually
                                            westwards from its . terminus at Wardian to Marsa
                                            Matrouh, has been of great benefit in developing the
                                            Mariout district. Last week the big condensing station,
                                            which his Highness bas been constructing at Hammam was
                                            completed. It cost £3,500 and will purify the water for
                                            the engines on bịs line. Although the water at Hammam is
                                            excellent for drinking purposes, it contains lime which
                                            has bad effects on the boilers and makes a condensing
                                            apparatus a necessity. The machinery, which is of
                                            Austrian make, is of the latest pattern. Another similar
                                            installation of condensing plant is to be set up at
                                            Dabbah.</p>
                                        <p>One of the important factors in the development of the
                                            Mariout district is the exploitation of gypsum, which is
                                            such a valuable commodity for building. The Khedive has
                                            built a new siding on his line at Cherbanyet for
                                            transporting the gypsum, as his Highness has about 400
                                            feddans of gypsum there."</p>
                                        <p>THE MARKETS.</p>
                                        <p> The market at Sidi Abdul Rahman, which was instituted by
                                            the Khediye last year, is growing in importance and is
                                            attended by an increasing number of people from the
                                            neighbourhood. There are four markets in Mariout, all of
                                            which were established by the Khedive, Hamman, Mondays,
                                            Beheig, Tuesdays, Amrieh Wednesdays, and Sidi Abdul
                                            Rahman, Saturdays.</p>
                                        <p>THE MARIOUT SURVEY. </p>
                                        <p>The survey of the Mariout district is proceeding
                                            satisfactorily and Mr. Montagu and Mr. Murray, who have
                                            been entrusted with this work, have reached Amrich,
                                            where their camp is now pitched. The operations of the
                                            survey of the north western district of Egypt is to
                                            extend up to the frontier of Tripoli at Salloum, and is
                                            to include the Oasis of Siwa on the South. It is
                                            expected that the work will take at least three years.
                                            There is at present no map of the country to the West of
                                            Alexandria. In fact even the frontier line is not
                                            determined, a fact of which the Turks took advantage of
                                            in occupying the important position of Sollom with its
                                            excellent harbour The survey will also be of
                                            considerable importance in the delimitation of the
                                            cultivated land which is increasing every year in area
                                            in this district</p>
                                        <p>THE TELEGRAPH.</p>
                                        <p> The telegraph line from Alexandria to Marsa Matronh was
                                            completed on the 28th ulta. Communication from Mersa
                                            Matrouh to the extreme westerly coast guard post at Sidi
                                            Berand is conducted by telephone</p>
                                        <p>THE POLICE</p>
                                        <p> The general state of public security in the Marion
                                            district is very good. Last month there were only seven
                                            police cases, which consisted of petty quarrels among
                                            the Bedonin inhabitants. The lawlessness prevailing
                                            there has greatly lessened during the past few years
                                            since the district was transferred to the control of the
                                            Alexandria Police from the Behera Moudirieb.</p>
                                        <p>The police will probably make a new station at El Anned
                                            shortly. There are now three stations, at Antrieb, 14
                                            men and 8 horses. Beheig, I men and 6 horses, and
                                            Hamman, where the Camel Corps is stationed consisting of
                                            10 men and 8 camels. These stations are under the
                                            inspection of Sagh. Kelham, and under the command of
                                            Yousbashi Mahmoud Sidky, the Mamour.</p>
                                        <p>PLAGUE AT ALEXANDRIA</p>
                                        <p>Another case of plague occurred at Alexandria at the
                                            Hotel de la Poste yesterday, the victim being Mme.
                                            Agolhon, widow of the proprietor, who died from the
                                            plague the day before yesterday. Mme. Agulhon was taken
                                            to the Greek hospital yesterday afternoon and lies there
                                            in a precarious condition.</p>
                                        <p>The hotel has been denounced by the sanitary authorities
                                            as unclean and infected by rats and mice, and the usual
                                            steps are being taken for disinfection and
                                            deratisation.</p>
                                        <p>The origin of the outbreak at this hotel is believed to
                                            be from a young Austrian man, and clerk of the Austrian
                                            Lloyd Steam ! ship Company Ltd., and by the name of
                                            Isetich, 25 years of age. Suffering greatly from his
                                            eyes, Izetich came from Suez to Alexandria for treatment
                                            and took a room at the Hotel de la Poste. His was the
                                            first case to be detected and, terminating fatally, he
                                            was buried yesterday morning.</p>
                                        <p>The official bulletin issued to-day also reports 1 death
                                            out of hospital at Beba, 2 recoveries at Beni Mazar, 1

                                        <p>A most interesting and useful compilation of statistics
                                            of the movement of shipping in the ports of Egypt has
                                            been issued by the Statistical Department of the
                                            Ministry of Finance. The most interesting statistics
                                            given will be published in our columns in and future
                                            issue. Meanwhile we publish the introductory remarks of
                                            the Director of the Department, which, we trust, will
                                            receive the fullest consideration from all shipping
                                            agoricios hero. The Director writes:</p>
                                        <p>The object of this Department in undertaking the
                                            organization of this enquiry was to collect and publish
                                            fall information on both the maritime commerce and
                                            navigation, and not only the movement of shipping which
                                            the pregent volume deals with. It is true that the
                                            quarterly returns issued during the year 1906, which are
                                            summarized in this volume, contained some data
                                            concerning passengers. But figures relating to landing
                                            passengers only, have a real value, for, this
                                            information is sapphed by the Quarantine Board whose
                                            officials Bre in a position to collectit with due
                                            accuracy. As to passengers embarked, the data furnished
                                            to this Department are very far from being correct The
                                            Bureau of Passports, which ought to be in a position to
                                            collect this information, has, on the one hand, a rather
                                            defective method of registering and, on the other hand,
                                            travellers are not obliged by the local regulations to
                                            make any statement at their departure and no passport is
                                            strictly required. Therefore, no information on
                                            passengers is given in this volume.</p>
                                        <p>From the beginning of 1906 this Department established a
                                            method of direct information by franchised postcards,
                                            which must be sent to this Department by the shipping
                                            agents at every departure and arrival of boats. In these
                                            nostoards the agents have to put down the tonnage of
                                            goods and the number of passengers embarked and landed.
                                            Very many among the most important shipping agencies
                                            established in the four principal ports of Egypt have
                                            agreed to send and are still forwarding the required
                                            statements. I am very grateful to these agents for their
                                            kind support, and bog to request that they will
                                            persevere in their cooperation in the future.
                                            Unfortunately many other agencies have not answered to
                                            the demand of this Department. I take the liberty of
                                            assuring them their reluctance pre indices both the
                                            interests of the companies they represent and the
                                            interests of the countries to which these companies
                                            belong and for whose benefit this enquiry is chiefly
                                            intended.</p>
                                        <p>The Government is, in this behalf, mainly inspired by its
                                            duty of throwing light on every field of the country's
                                            activity, in order to place at the disposal of those who
                                            are interested the means of increasing their own
                                            well-being. Nevertheless, this Department, trusting in
                                            the support given by the important agencies, persists in
                                            its first purpose, and hopes to soon be able to obtain
                                            the consent and co-operation of the hesitating minority
                                            of agents..</p>
                                        <p>With a view of facilitating the desired achievement, this
                                            Department has elaborated a new scheme which will be
                                            applied from January next, replacing the postcards
                                            system, This new plan is much simpler than the former.
                                            Thus, I hope that, on account of the trivial work which
                                            it will cause to the agents and the securities it offers
                                            to them, this Bureau may may be able to publish next
                                            year complete information on the maritime commerce and
                                            passenger traffic with foreign countries, attaining this
                                            the end to which the constant efforts of this Department
                                            are directed.</p>

                                            such as Youssef Bey Franco, his brother-inlaw, a large
                                            crowd of the Opposition party, numbering over two
                                            thousand Lebanese Christians and Druses, came down to
                                            Beyrout and made an important demonstration at the
                                            Seraglio at different Consulates General. An eye witness
                                            says that at the Seraglio the representative heads of
                                            the crowd clamoured for justice and appealed to the Vali
                                            to solicit His Majesty to see that a just and upright
                                            Governor should at last be sent to Lebanon and save the
                                            further oppression of the desperate population. His
                                            Excellency haying calmed them with kind promises loud
                                            cheers and acclamations burst from the crowd with loud

                                            occurrence of an event of this sort an enquiry is made
                                            in order to ascertain and put on record all the
                                            particulars pertaining to it.</p>
                                        <p>We learn that the search parties which went out to look
                                            for the missing men met with many hardships. The heat
                                            was so intense that even the Bedouins who accompanied
                                            the party sufig red from it. Their supply of water was
                                            used up so fast that they could not extend their search
                                            as they had first intended.</p>
                                        <p>The Camel Corps post at Bir Natrun has now been
                                            withdrawn, at least until next October. In the meanwhile
                                            it is stationed at Dongola.</p>

                                        <head>THE BATTLE OF ROSETTA.</head>
                                        <p>A hundred years ago the most serious defeat that England
                                            ever met with in Egypt happened and by a curious
                                            coincidence the Scotch general, who led the troops and
                                            perished in the disaster, bore the same name and
                                            belonged to the same family as the general who fell a
                                            few years ago in the most serious disaster that befell
                                            us in the Boer war, The following is the first account
                                            of the calamity, which reached England and appeared in
                                            the "Times" of June 12th, 1807 :</p>
                                        <p>The "Pompée," Sir Sidney Smith, whose Approval from the
                                            Mediterranean we announced yesterday, has brought
                                            intelligence of a very unpleasant nature. That part of
                                            our army, which was detached from Alexandria against
                                            Rosetta, has been defeated with great loss. Our readers
                                            will recollect, that in our anticipation of the Hamburg
                                            Mailon Wednesday, we alluded to this melancholy ovent.
                                            The private information which we then were in possession
                                            of, would have justified as in announcing it in a much
                                            stronger manner.</p>
                                        <p>That we did not was owing to the peculiar delicacy of the
                                            circumstance, as well as the difficulty of the situation
                                            in which we were placed. Thó bouro from which we derived
                                            our intelligence,' has in no one instance ever misled
                                            us, and its communications are entitled to implicit
                                            confidence and respect; but we shrunk from being the
                                            first to announce great public calamity. We, therefore,
                                            restricted, our communication to hinting at the
                                            disaster, and stating the scene of the misfortune,
                                            confident that the melancholy corroboration of our
                                            intelligence could not be long delayed.</p>
                                        <p>The particulars of this unfortunate affair, as well as we
                                            have been able to collect them, are these. It is known,
                                            though the fasot is not stated in General Fraser's
                                            dispatch, that immediately after the surrender of
                                            Alexandria, and respectable force was detached by him
                                            against Rosetta, the command of which was confided to
                                            Major General Wanchope. They advanced against it under
                                            the impression that they should moot with no resistance.
                                            No forco appeared for the purpose of obstructing their
                                            march. The head of the column had, however, scarcely
                                            entered the town, when it was assailed by a destructive
                                            fire from a vast number of Turks and Albanians, who were
                                            posted in the houses and different buildings. The
                                            contest was unequal, and our troops were under the
                                            necessity of retreating. They accordingly evacuated the
                                            town, and took the best position they could, under the
                                            circumstances ; but kaving, as we are informed, been
                                            joined by some reinforcements from Alexandria, they
                                            again advanced, and gave battle to an enemy infinitely
                                            superior to them in numbers. The result was such as we
                                            set out with stating; they were defeated, with very
                                            great loss indeed. In the first affair, the extent of
                                            our loss was about 150 killed and wounded. In the
                                            second, it was upwards of s thousand. We have not been
                                            able to ascertain whether any prisoners were made; bot
                                            the total loss was probably not much under 1200 mer, or
                                            half perhaps of the force which was engaged. The remains
                                            of this gallant little band made good their retreat to
                                            Alexandria where they remain. The Commander of the
                                            expedition, Major General Wauchope, fell. Brigadier
                                            General Meade, the next in command, was wounded, but, we
                                            are happy to bear, not badly. Several other officers
                                            were also slightly wounded, who were fast recovering -
                                            when the dispatches were sent off.</p>

                                            <p>We have little to add to the particulars of the
                                                recent disaster in Egypt which we gave yesterday. A
                                                Packet from Malte arrived at Falmouth on Tuesday,
                                                but it has not brought 30 late intelligence as the
                                                "Pompée," which sailed some days after. The official
                                                account of the second action, fought, as it is said,
                                                on the 19th of April, bas not we understand, been
                                                yet received; that of the first has, and will
                                                probably appear in the Gazette of this evening.</p>
                                            <p>We are not yet sufficiently in porsession of the
                                                circumstances of this unexpected event to be able to
                                                pronounce an impartial opinion upon it. The first
                                                action, as we have before stated, took place in the
                                                town of Rosetta, into which, it is said the division
                                                under General Wauchope incautiously entered. It is
                                                possible that the little resistance made at
                                                Alexandria, and the persuasion that the population
                                                of the country were friendly, might have lulled that
                                                officer into a confidence, which has been attended
                                                with fatal results. This is some excuse for him; and
                                                the manner and gallantry of his fall is sufficient
                                                atonement for his indiscretion, if any there has
                                                been. But to such indulgence we cannot admit the
                                                second attempt is in the least entitled. Nothing but
                                                the certainty of a décisive victory, or to avoid the
                                                horrors of impending famine, should have induced the
                                                officer, who had the chief command, to risk a second
                                                action.</p>
