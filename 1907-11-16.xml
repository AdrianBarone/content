                    <p>"When we read the reports of the financial
                    situation in America, we are reminded of the
                    picturesque account which Lord Cromer gave
                    as the other day of the habits of the people of
                    Egypt,” says the “Westminster Gazette” Nov.
                    5). “These people, it seems, have so little faith
                    in banks and credit institutions that they
                    cannot be induced to part with their gold when
                    they have once got it into their possession. A
                    vast deal of money. goes into Egypt which
                    never comes out in; how mach, we may
                    judge from the fact that during the last four
                    years the imports: of gold have been thirteen
                    millions more than the exports.</p>
                    
                    <p>“What becomes of this vast quantity of coin !
                    A great deal, Lord Cramer tells us, is manu-
                    factured into jewelry. It is estimated that
                    last year between one and half and two mil-
                    lions was disposed of in this way alone. The
                    rest is hoarded. Lord Cromer tells us that a
                    little while ago he heard of an Egyptian gentle-
                    man who died leaving a fortune of £80,000,
                    the whole of which was found in his cellars.
                    Then, again, he heard of a substantial yeoman
                    who bought a property for £25,000. Half an
                    hoar after the contract was signed he appeared
                    with a train of donkeys bearing on their backs
                    the money, which bad been buried in his
                    garden.</p>
                    
                    <p>“The European is at first tempted to cry out
                    at the extreme folly of these simple people
                    who deprive themselves of income in order to
                    secure their capital. But he too, perhaps, when
                    he considers the dismal tale of the stock and
                    share lists and counts up his capital losses on
                    money securely invested in high-class securities,
                    say, four years ago, may say to himself on
                    further reflection that these people have after
                    all not proved so very foolish. - ‘The argument
                    is not to be pressed too far, or prudent hus-
                    bands and fathers of families may find them
                    selves beset by wives and daughters imploring
                    them, in the name of thrift, the convert their
                    surplus gold into articles of stable value which
                    adorn the person instead of throwing it down
                    the gulf of depreciating securities.</p>
                    
                    <p>“But it isa very thin line which divides the
                    civilised man from the primitive, and the
                    present mood of the American man is to stick
                    to his gold and keep it in cellars and back
                    gardens, now that he has happily rescued it
                    from the banks and the millionaires. Hence
                    the extreme disorganization of the currency in
                    America, and the frantic pull on the limited
                    supply of European gold which compelled the
                    Directors of the Bank of England yesterday
                    (Nov. 4) to protect their position by raising
                    the Bank rate to 6 per cent., with, possibly, a
                    further rise to follow.</p>
                    
                    <p>“The fact faces us that no possible accumu-
                    lation of gold could avail us in presence ot
                    anything like a general breakdown of the
                    the credit system. Modern industry and com-
                    merce refuse to be controlled by the output of
                    the gold mines of the world, however much it
                    may be influenced by the fluctuations in prices
                    which follow from a shortage or excess of the
                    gold supply.</p>
                    
                    <p>“The panic in America, which has sent
                    people running to the banks for their gold, is
                    due simply to the fact that depositors have
                    lost faith in the honesty or discretion (or both)
                    of certain men and groups of men who are tem-
                    porarily masters of their credit. At this point
                    the remedies are twofold. There is, first, the
                    temporary remedy to be applied by the Govern-
                    ment and the leading financiers in concert to
                    restore cash payment or payment in notes, which
                    are the equivalent of cash; and there is,
                    secondly, the permanent remedy, in which also
                    the Government must take a hand, of saving
                    the public and the industry of the country
                    from the wild gambling and dishonest dealing
                    which, if it continued, would rot the whole
                    fabric of trade and credit.</p>
                    <p>“President Roosevelt is trying to apply both
                    remedies simultaneously. Trade and industry
                    in America, like industry a few years ago in
                    South Africa, are temporarily on a basis of un-
                    real speculative values, which must gradually
                    be brought down to hard fact, It will take time,
                    and it will be accompanied by temporary hard-
                    ship to many people and interests, but the
                    American people have shown more than once
                    that they are capable of conducting this opera-
                    tion with great thoroughness, and we have
                    much belief in their capacity to do if again,”</p>
