                    <head>S.P.C.A</head>
                    <p> The eleventh annual report of the Cairo branch of the S.P.C.A. contains muoh
                        interesting information for the friends of animals and fall statistical
                        tables which show the excellent work done during the past year both by the
                        Cairo branch and by the affiliated branches in the provinces. The increased
                        receipts show that the society is doing well from a financial point of view,
                        the convictions for various forms of ornelty show &amp; gratifying decrease,
                        and the infirmary has been thoroughly repaired and rearra" ged. All these
                        facts are in the highest degree satisfactory, but there are two points in
                        the report that are not altogether pleasant reading for the humane: we refer
                        to the apparent reluctance of the tourist to assist the society and to the
                        growing practice of underpaying cab-drivers. Mr. Rambold, who has done so
                        much for the society daring the last few years, writes on the latter subject
                        with most commendable frankness. After pointing out that the condition of
                        the cab-borses in Cairo during the past summer and autumn has been worse
                        than at any time döring. recent years owing to the unusually high price of
                        forage and the low tariff, he shows that owners of cab-horses will
                        appropriate the same margin of profit as they have done in the days of cheap
                        forage. The price of tibn and coro increases bat only the same amount is
                        spent on feeding the horses. </p>
                    <p> Bat what aggravates the situation is the habit of systematically underpaying
                        the cabdrivers, on which the Hon. Secretary of the Cairo branch of the
                        S.P.C.A. bas much to say. The remarks which follow perhaps seem to
                        constitute rather too severe an indictment of certain Earopeans of the
                        higher class, bat we have good reason to know that they are not in the
                        slightest degree exaggerated. Mr. Rambold says : "It is to be regretted that
                        the practice of paying even less than the fare is occasionally followed by
                        Englishmen and other Europeang of the higher class, who might be expected to
                        know better. The argument that when the cabdriver is overpaid he will
                        reserve the excess fare for himself, and not devote it to giving his animals
                        more to eat, may possibly hold good in some cases ; bat, by slightly
                        overpaying a cab driver, he is "given the opportunity of improving the
                        condition of his ani: mals. If he is, ander-paid, he is deprived of all
                        chance of doing so, unless he is willing to starve himself. The society have
                        been unable to do more than arrest the worst cases and treat them at the
                        Infirmary. Ao argument which, strange as it may seem, has been advanced in
                        defence of paying the cab-driver less than his proper fare is' that,
                        although the tariff is indicated on a plate in every cab, it has no legal
                        sanction. This argument is as erroneous as it is unworthy. The cab-tariff in
                        Csiro is enacted by the Governor of Cairo and approved by the Mixed Courts.
                        It is, therefore, binding on foreigners, and, in the event of their paying
                        less than the legal fare, the cabdrivers would have ground for an action in
                        the Mixed Courts. It need scarcely be remarked that &amp; recourse to this
                        remedy is entirely beyond the means of the majority of drivers, who must be
                        content to see themselves defrauded of their proper fare." </p>
                    <p> As for tourist donations, we feel that it is hopeless to expect much from
                        these birds of passage. A few years ago, when beasts covered with wounds and
                        sores horrified the sensitive nerves of the visitor to Egypt, donations were
                        frequent enough. Nowadays the tourist realises that the neighbourhood of
                        Shepbeard's and the Savoy Hotel is free from soola sights and is quite
                        satisfied. The fact that brutalities, the sight of which would disgust and
                        sicken bim, are too frequent in the villages and country towns of Egypt,
                        does not intrude upon his serenely optimistic assumption that the S.P.C.A.
                        has no further need of his help.  </p>

                <p>It has been an open secret for some time that Germany has been actively at work
                    in the direction of obtaining from Turkey the concession of a port which could
                    be turned into a naval station and coaling station. The Copatantinople
                    correspondent of 'Le Petit Parisien" writes that Germany has made choice of the
                    island of Thasos, in the extreme north of the Ægean Sea. The island was given to
                    the Khedive Ismail Pasha, and the present Khedive is now its owner. Although the
                    Khedive has worked the greater sart of the land and forests, he has granted
                    certain concessions for exploiting the natural wealth of Thasos. The most
                    important of these concassiops is one which we obtained some years ago by a
                    syndicate of German Jews for the purpose of cutting down the timber. This
                    syndicate was supported well by the German Government, and thanks to soch
                    support from home it was able last year to obtain the right of working the
                    mineral wealth of Thasos. The German Ambassador at the Porte bas demanded from
                    Turkey the cagion of a harbour on Thasos in the interests of Germany's growing
                    trade, and with a view to establishing thera a coaling station for the German
                    Navy. This demand has been considered by the Porte. and rumour says that Germany
                    will obtain the harbour which it has demanded.</p>

                <head>ANNUAL IRISH DINNER.</head>
                <p>On Saturday (St. Patrick's Day), the annual Irish dinner was held at Shephe-rd's
                    and proved a thorough success. The table decorations, in which the shamrock
                    'figured largely, were ornamental at first and useful as the evening wore on,
                    and the band of the 2nd Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers played a series of
                    selections of thoroughly national character though we missed certain airs which
                    were perhaps regarded as "party tapes."</p>
                <p>Thirty-five Irisbmen in all were present, Johnson Pacha taking the chair, and a
                    telegram was received early in the evening from the Innis killings in Crete
                    wishing success to the banquet and good fortune to the Irishmen in Cairo. The
                    Toasts of “The King,” "Ireland,” The Services," and “Ourselves” met with a great
                    reception and a number of speeches were made several simultaneously.</p>
                <p>Among those present were Johnson Paoba. Dr. Restinge. Capt. Mackenzie, Dr. Norman
                    Capt. Evans, Dr Garner, Messrs. Langley Carren, McLoughlin, Weldon, O'Sullivan,
                    Bewley, Young, Graves, Mackenzie, Rafferty, Duke, Kearney. FitzPatrick, de la

                    McDonnell, Delaney, Parser, Smith and Boxwell.</p>
                <p>The thanks of all are due to Johnson Poche and to Mr. Weldon, to whose exertions
                    the success of the banquet were mainly due.</p>

                <p>Minieh, Saturday. Minieh yesterday was en fête In the forenoon the annual Horse
                    Show was held at which the judging was done by a Commission including HH Prince
                    Omar Toussoun, Ahmed Bey Bakri and Mr. Littlewood. In the afternoon, thanks to
                    the enterprise and generosity of Omar Bey Soltan, a most successful and
                    enjoyable Skye Meeting was held. Omar Bey has laid sat a pretty mile (ourse on
                    his estate at Damaris, and thanks to his energy and the efforts of the hon.
                    seo., Mohamed Bfi. Naguib, &amp; very good entry was received for the five races
                    of which the programme consisted. Of these, three were won by Fenwick, who had
                    come down to ride, but undoubtedly the event of the afternoon was the race, open
                    to gentlemen riders only, for the bandsome silver cap. presented by Omar Boy
                    Sultan. The trophy was carried off by Mr. Boxwell on Patrick, M. Philippa
                    finishing second. In the other events some excellent racing was seen, and the
                    sportsmanlike manner in which all the local competitors rode augurs well for the
                    success of future meetings. Mr. Haselden is to be congratulated on the
                    successful manner in which he discharged the duties of starter. An excellent tea
                    was provided by Omar Bey Sultan, and the intervals were enlivened by the local
                    band discoursing popular air. The prizes were distributed by H.E. the Mondir,
                    Soliman Bey Osman, and the proceedings closed with three bearty cheers for Omar
                    Bey Sultan, who had provided 08 with such an excellent afternoon's sport. There
                    were at least 5,000 spectators present and in addition to all the local
                    celebrities, we noticed many visitors from Assiout, Beni Suof and the Fayoum.
                    The police arrangements under Mr. Hopkins were excellent.</p>
                <p>A most enjoyable garden-party was afterwards held by Mrs. Hopkins ar d Mrs. Noel
                    Haselden at the former's house, during which Mr. Burnand delighted all present
                    with his spirited imitations. In the evening dinner parties were given by Mrs.

                    the course helps to keep alert the attention. This season, too, we have bad but
                    few of these informal meetings, and affinity stakes, hattrimming competitions,
                    dak competitions, and the like brought back a flavour of the East and were
                    welcome to many for old association's zake. The attendance was very large and
                    the interest great, as there were but few who had not some friends competing for
                    at least one of the eight events.</p>

                <p>The next event was &amp; half-mile race for Arabs that had never raced before in
                    any other than gymkhana races and that had never been trained, catch weights,
                    for which there were 12 entries. All the horses started in a bunch and there was
                    but little to choose among them until the curve was reached, when Mr. Miller got
                    well ahead in the straight. However, Capt. Hills, riding Major Palmer's horse,
                    drew up and finally gained the lead and won in splendid style, Mr. Miller coming
                    in second and Mr. Loftus a fairly good third.</p>
                <p>The Affinity Stakes, in which a gentleman and &amp; lady holding a ribbon between
                    them galloped 200 yards round &amp; post and returned to winning post without
                    letting go the ribbon, was ron in two beats, the first two of each competing in
                    the final. In the first beat Mr. Dalby and Mrs. Bayley ran home first, closely
                    followed by Mr. Langley and Mrs. Molesworth, and in the second heat Capt. Rome
                    and Mrs. Blyth ran in well in advance of the rest of the field. The final
                    resulted in a close race between Mr. Dalby and Mrs. Mackenzie and Captain and
                    Mrs. Rome, the former pair winning narrowly. </p>
                <p>In the hat-trimming competition there was much amusement. In not a few cases the
                    trimming refused to stop on the bat and some of the riders lost their hats
                    altogether. Mr. R. E. Fischer was distinctly unfortunate in losing his horse,
                    which got away while the bats were being trimmed and was caught with difficulty.
                    The winner was Lieut. Mellor, with Mr. Gordop as bi- milliner, and the ropner op
                    Mr. Mason, who was partnered by Mrs. Stobbs.</p>
                <p>Considerable excitement was caused by the dak race, in which competitors had to
                    drive at the trot for about ¼ mile, unharness and saddle the same pony, and ride
                    roand a post: 200 yards away, returning to winning post. Several of the horses
                    were most restive and difficult to unharness. One broke through the railings,
                    carrying the dogcart which he was drawing with him, and then turned it on its
                    side, while another broke away from its trap and was not caught for some time.
                    Mr. Mason came in first unchallenged and Mr. Langley gained second place. In the
                    Ladies' Sourry, which consisted of a two furlongs pony race the most notable
                    feature was the splendid riding of Miss Blyth, who came in an easy winner,
                    though Miss Farcar also rode well and deserved the award of second place as she
                    led the rest of the field by several lengths.</p>
                <p>Mr. Dalby was unfortunate in not winning the Housekeeping Stakes, in which an
                    addition arm was entrusted to ladies, as he came in first, bint the judges were
                    unable to accept Mrs. Beyley's Addition, and the prize was therefore awarded to
                    Mr. Akers Douglas, who came in second with a sum correctly added up by Mrs.
                    Satow.</p>
                <p>In the final event a lady and gentleman had to ride together, the former tilting
                    a ring and the latter taking a peg with a sword. The award was given on the best
                    of rounds and Mr. Protheroe-Smith and Mrs. Rome proved the winners, the former
                    taking the peg at both rounds, and the latter carrying the ring away at the
                    second attempt. Mr. Goodchild and Mrs. Mackenzie were also both successful at
                    the first trial bnt in the recond round Mr. Goodchild missed the peg, though his
                    partner again carried off the ring.</p>
