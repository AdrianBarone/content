                            <p>‘‘Al Minbar,” in a recent article, reproves the authors of
                                the “demands” published re- cently in the Native Press for
                                the foolish and impracticable character of their proposals.
                                The confession, “At this stage uf our national advance weare
                                like children, who can avoid a tumble now and again,”
                                applies perfectly to the rather absurd young men who combine
                                Free Trade and Protection, the principles of the French
                                Revolution, and the notions that were out of date in Saleh
                                ed Din’s days ; and the Editor of the “Minbar” rightly warns
                                his readers that other nations’ eyes are fixed on Egypt and
                                that “they will respect us only on condition that we respect
                                ourselves and stand equally aloof from persoaal ambition and
                                from infantile conduct ” Our contemporary follows up his
                                criticism by a vigorous denunciation of the agitation
                                against the British sovereign (we refer to the coin worth
                                P.T 974) .and the proposal to fix the price of necessaties
                                by means of chambers of commerce, which, it rightly remarks,
                                have excited the satirical contempt of a large section of
                                the European Press in Egypt. — But while we agree with our
                                contemporary we cannot refrain from concealing our surprise
                                that the strange demands to which we have referred passed
                                unnoticed, or almost unnoticed, till the European Press had
                                had its laugh. But for ‘Al Minbar” they would apparently
                                have passed almost uncriticised, and a cruel deduc- tion
                                might have been drawn from the fact. It is—as our
                                contemporary remarks—hard to prevent young people making
                                fools of them- selves, and we are not surprised that a good
                                few young Egyptians show more zeal than intelligence in
                                their proposals What amazes us is that such proposals are
                                not more rapidly seized and criticised by the men whose
                                cause they harm, that it should be left to the European
                                Press to dissect them first, and to occasional native papers
                                to complete the operation </p>

                                <p>At the annual meeting of the Manchester Chamber of
                                    Commerce last week,the President, in reviewing the
                                    cotton trade of the past year, mentioned that Turkey wes
                                    the third largest purchaser of cotton goods from the
                                    United Kingdom. In cottons, he said, “The Turk buys from
                                    the United Kingdom more than the whole of the rest of
                                    Europe. Although the national finances of Turkey left as
                                    a whole much to be desired, its economic condition was
                                    steadily improving ; the provision of railways in Asia
                                    Minor had acted as a great incentive to in- dustry.
                                    @wing to an increase of transport baving been provided,
                                    the people were en- couraged to devote more attention to
                                    agricul- ture. Therefore it would be the duty of the
                                    Chamber of Commerce to impress on the Foreign Office the
                                    supreme importance of that market to Lancashire, and to
                                    watch and guard against, if possible, any attempt to
                                    raise the Turkish import duties to an excessive level,
                                    To what an almost incalculable amount the consuming
                                    powers of Turkey would reach under honest government we
                                    have exemplified in Egypt, now our fourth best buyer of
                                    cotton goods. Able and wise government had worked
                                    miiacies, and Egypt was using 297 mil ion yards—almost
                                    double the amount purchased from us in 1898. A striking
                                    contrast to the last-mentioned markets were the
                                    wretchedly governed foreign West Indies and Central
                                    American Republic (Venezuela, Colombia, Guatemala, San
                                    Salvador, Honduras,and Costa Rica), who, with their
                                    chronic revolutions, miserable petty jealousies,; and
                                    armies of generals with consular officers, and
                                    restriction at every port, were unable to develop their
                                    im. mense mineral and agricultural resources ; their
                                    trade remained stationary, even if it did not
                                    decrease.”</p>

                                            <p>Five fires occurred in Alexandria last night, and the
                                                Fire Brigade, under Yonsha- bi Waller, was busily
                                                engaged in coping with its many calls. The
                                                conflagrations took place at Bab Sidre, where a
                                                stable caught fire ; at Gheit el- Enab, on the south
                                                bank of the canal, where a large straw store was
                                                burnt out ; in Rue Hamamil, where a beer shop was
                                                burnt ; in Rue Abon Siri, where a café caught fire;
                                                and lastly in a shop in Sisters-street. The most
                                                serious of these conflagrations was that on the
                                                canal. The fire broke out in a very large store of
                                                straw and it was only got under with great
                                                difficulty, the hose having to be laid across the
                                                canal under the water. The Fire Brigade was hard at
                                                work there for two hours, from 11.50 p.m. to 2 a.m.

                                                  the Marqois Francesco Filiasi and Maestro Vinoe:zv
                                                  Cantani’s programme was ececated. To begin witb,
                                                  Grieg’s Sonata ()p. 45) was effectively
                                                  interpreted, par- t calarly as regards the
                                                  pianoforte score. Chopin was then drawn upon for
                                                  two Preludes (17-22) which were ascoorately taken
                                                  ; followed by Nootarne No. 1 (Op. 62), which
                                                  proved less attractive than its successor, the
                                                  Polonaise No. 9 (Op. 40). Here the Marqaise
                                                  Filiasi’s tech- niqne showed to great advantage,
                                                  though his touch is perhaps not all that might be
                                                  desired. Maestro Cantaoi then gave two movements
                                                  of Max Broach, of which the rendering of the
                                                  Adagio was as expressive and delicate as that cf

                                                  the theatre. The house was tastefully decorated
                                                  and the stage was converted into a lounge. The
                                                  dance was tairly well attended and it is said that
