                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed to
                        Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel accommodation
                        for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr. Najem Houry
                        proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent
                        Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to
                        Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
                        Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                        Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                        begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                        Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                        scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                        in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <p>THE HOME PRESS ON EGYPTS PROSPERITY. </p>
                    <p>In a leading article on the growing prosperity of Egypt shown in the note of
                        Sir Vincent Corbett, the "Manchester Courier" says: The strongly-worded
                        expressions of satisfaction with the economie record of Egypt during 1906
                        will be a cause of general satisfaction. In particular, we are glad to note
                        his reference to the large amount of the cotton crop and his opinion that
                        the estimate of next year's surplus of revenue over expenditure at over half
                        a million sterling is a cautious one, Commenting on tho startling fact that
                        since 1900 the relation of exports to imports has changed from an excess of
                        three-and-a-half millions to the very reverse, Sir Vincent Corbett says that
                        "even if these figures imply that Egypt has been paying for her imports with
                        funds advanced by the foreign capitalist, there is nothing necessarily
                        alarming in the fact, so long as the capital in question is employed for the
                        purpose of remunerative enterprise.” This is a valuable caution in view of
                        the fact that since the financial controversy turned every man into a
                        political economist, each amateur of the science has the strong feeling that
                        no nation can be prosperous whose imports exceed its exports--an economic
                        generalisation which requires, like every other economic dictum, to be
                        qualified in view of any particular case. Thus in Japan the gold borrowed
                        during the war has been the cause of unexampled energy in business,
                        Increased capital enables industries for which the country offers natural
                        facilities to be developed to their utmost extent, easily paying the
                        interest on what has been borrowed. In the case of Egypt it is the
                        development of cotton-grow. ing that has attracted the additional capital,
                        four million exported from England in October to pay for the crop being
                        responsible for the excess of imports over exports, and incidentally for the
                        rise in the Bank of England rate. Egypt's demand for gold is an annual
                        occurrence. rence, as there is an extreme reluctance on the part of the
                        native cultivator "to accept anything but actual coin in payment of his
                        cotton" and Sir Vincent Corbett's caution is extremely valuable since a
                        combination of other circumstances having necessitated the rise of the Bank
                        rate to 6 per cent. men's attention was drawn to the state of Egyptian
                        finance, with the result that apprehension was expressed in some quarters.
                        Sir Vincent Corbett accordingly: emphasises the fact that "the recent demand
                        was a purely trade demand, and was in no way connected with the financing of
                        speculativo operations." When we remember that there has been a rapid
                        increase, of late years, in the prosperity of Egypt it is likewise
                        permissible to hope that the pessimism in estimating next year's revenue
                        will not be justified. The cotton crop, which is of the utmost importance to
                        this country as well as to Egypt, still depends very much on the vagaries of
                        the River Nile, and it is urgently necessary that large sums bo rendered
                        available for the construction of irrigation and other public works. It is
                        accordingly, particularly to be deplored that the Denshawai Incident of last
                        year has rendered necessary a permanent charge of nearly fifty thousand
                        pounds a year for the reinforced British.</p>

                <p>A Useful Annual.</p>
                <p>To anyone who is in any way interested in any part of Africa, the "African World
                    Annual" for 1906, published by our live contemporary the "African World" at the
                    modest price of 2s., is well nigh indispensable. Every part of this vast
                    continent finds a place in this bulky publication, and one of the most prominent
                    is Egypt, which has many interesting and instructive articles devoted to it,
                    accompanied by numerous excellent illustrations. Indeed, "Egypt in 1906"'is one
                    of the special features of a work which is oram full of notable contributions of
                    the most up-to-date character. A large portion is concerned with South African
                    mining, about which readers will find much exceedingly useful information, but
                    in the 300 odd pages which the annual containing space is found for dealing
                    effectively with every portion of Africa. The get-up and illustrations are
                    simply superb, and Mr. Leb Weintbal and Mr. J. Hartley Knight, the editors, are
                    to be congratulated on what is altogether a remarkable achievement. The
                    publishing offices are at Bourne House, 34, Copthall avenue, London, E.C. ..</p>

                    <p>EGYPTIAN ESTIMATION.</p>
                    <p>The native press is still occupied with the doings of Mr. J. M. Robertson, M.
                        P., who slept at Burma on Sunday and was yesterday at Jantah. "Al Abram ''
                        says :Mr. Robertson, M.P., is travelling in Egypt as a private gentleman.
                        Every Egyptian is yearning to see him, and is eager to offer every possible
                        service relative to the object he has in view. But he is studying the
                        conditions of this country alone, undisturbed by the controversies of the
                        newspapers or the selfish aims of other people. When the Egyptian pronounces
                        the name of Robertson 'a happy smile can be seen playing around his lips. If
                        we cannot approach this M P., in order to bring our complaints to him,
                        fearing lest the useful aims which he has in view will thereby be booked, we
                        can nevertheless tell the English that we love and esteem Mr. Robertson, for
                        the Egyptians do not dislike the English, but they do dislike to see some of
                        their officials attacking the sentiments of the natives in England, where
                        Egyptian public opinion and aspirations are held of no account. The
                        Egyptians respect Mr. Robertson not because he has promised to remove the
                        British Occupation from the Nile Valley, nor because he can counter to his
                        conntrymen's opinions, but because he showed his great sympathy for Egypt in
                        the House of Commons, and his conviction is that the people of Egypt hold
                        opinions and possess rights which should not be trampled on. The Egyptians
                        like Mr. Robertson because he has spoken the truth. The Anglo-Egyptian here
                        could have been similarly esteemed by the natives if only they had adopted
                        the same policy as Mr. Robertson. The Egyptians I will never be content with
                        the Occupation as long as they remain Egyptians. When the occupants of Egypt
                        consider the natives as the real owners of Egypt then they will be esteemed
                        by the natives. The nation I will never forget its political rights, however
                        much it may owe to the occupants for their improvement in the financial
                        state of the country. Egypt wants to be independent.</p>

                    <p>For a man who is no longer young, M. Saint-Saeil, who has just arrived at
                        Cairo, continues to display a praiseworthy activity. He only returned to
                        Paris on Thursday week from New York, and at once started off to Egypt. He
                        stayed forty-eight hours in Paris, and spent most of that time answering
                        letters, which so tired him that he was too fatigued even to go to the Opera
                        to see "Ariane," Massanet's last chef d'ænvre. The veteran composer will be
                        in Egypt for a few weeks' well earned repose. At the end of February he is
                        in Monte Carlo to superintend the production of "Timbre d'Argent," and a
                        month later he will return to Paris. He is very much pleased with his recent
                        tour in America. President Roosevelt gave him a charming reception, and in
                        all the large cities he was delighted to find audiences who loved
                        music-especially French music--and who listened to it with a soul and with
                        religion. Shortly after M. Saint Saens left Havre on his way to New York, he
                        was taken so ill with an angina that at one time grave fears were
                        entertained as to the result. During his stay in Cairo he will be the guest
                        of Prince Mohamed Aly Pasha. </p>

                    <head>THE INDIAN MAILS.</head>
                    <p>THE TRANSIT THROUGH EGYPT.</p>
                    <p>Correspondence has passed recently between the British Chamber of Commerce of
                        Egypt and Lord Cromer on the subject of the acceleration of the Indian
                        mails. It is satisfactory to note that his Lordship has kindly consented to
                        move in the matter. Writing to Lord Cromer on the 9th December last, Mr. H.
                        P. Kingham, president of the Chamber, said : "At the request of my
                        committee, I have the honour to draw your Lordship's attention to the
                        question of the transit of the Indian mails through Egypt. The chief
                        obstacle pot forward in the past against the transit overland from
                        Alexandria to Suez was the risk of inconvenience by quarantine-especially at
                        Suez-owing to the frequency of plague or cholera in India. It is, however,
                        well recognised, especially since the Anglo-French agreement, that the
                        imposition of quarantine is much less frequent, and less severe, than was
                        the case in years past. Further, it has become a custom in Europe, on
                        occasions, to run trains in quarantine through an entire country. This, my
                        committee suggests, could be done in Egypt, and that obstacle, therefore,
                        has not the importance that it had formerly. </p>
                    <p>“My committee desires to emphasise the gain in time in the delivery of mail
                        that would be affected by the overland transit. The mail steamer from
                        Brindisi now reaches Port Said each Wednesday morning by boat. 6 o'clock.
                        The same steamer could reach Alexandria, owing to the shorter voyage, at
                        about 6 o'clock on Tuesday evening. As the Egyptian Railways run on to the
                        quays at Alexandria, a train could be waiting alongside ready to receive
                        mail and passengers ; the latter would then be carried directly to Suez,
                        reaching there at an early hour on Wednesday morning. The mails would thus
                        be put on board the East going steamer at Suez at the same time that they
                        are now put on board the same steamer at Port Said. By this means, India and
                        the Far East - would have their mails expedited by the adoration of the
                        steamer's passage through the Suez y Capel, which represents some 24 hours. </p>
                    <p>The gain to Egypt would be as follows: In Cairo, at present, the mails are
                        delivered some time on Wednesday afternoon, whereas if dispatched from
                        Alexandria they would be distributed by the first delivery on Wednesday
                        morning. In Alexandria, the mails now arrive at about 8 o'clock on Wednesday
                        evening, and are distributed by the first delivery on Thursday morning,
                        whereas if landed on Tuesday, evening they would be distributed by the first
                        delivery on Wednesday morning : a full 24 hours could thus be gained by the
                        commercial community in Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>The commerce of Alexandria (which means the greater part of the commerce as
                        of the whole of Egypt) has become so extensive and important that
                        acceleration of the mails would be of considerable activity.</p>
                    <p>"My committee gratefully recognises the efforts which your Lordship has made
                        comparatively recently in the above matter, but, at the same time, ventures
                        to hope that you may see the expediency of re-opening the question."</p>
                    <p>To the above communication Lord Cromer b replied :</p>
                    <p>"I am receipt of your letter of the 19th instant on the sobject of the
                        transit of the mails through Egypt. I propose to send this communication to
                        London. I may, however, remark that when this question was fully examined
                        some while ago, my impression is that It was found that taking into account
                        the delays which would be caused by an addition transhipment of the mails,
                        the saving of time would be a good deal less than 24 hours.”</p>

                    <p>ERNEST H. CROSBY.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ernest H. Crosby, whose death was announced last week, was born in 1856,
                        and was the son of the Rev. Howard Crosby, the well-known Presbyterian
                        minister of New York. In 1887 he became a member of the New York Assembly,
                        but in two years became disgusted with politics, and was in 1889 nominated
                        by President Harrison and appointed by the Khedive American Judge of the
                        International Tribunal of First Instance at Alexandria, ln 1894 he resigned,
                        and on his way home came under the influence of Count Tolstoy, with whom he
                        stayed for some time and continued in frequent correspondence. On his return
                        to America he bought an estate-Grasmere-alto Rhinebeck, on the Hudson River,
                        and carried out as far as possible his Tolstoyan ideas by profase and
                        perhaps indiscriminate charity to any and every one who appealed to him. He
                        identified himself with socials in reform and the Anti Imperialist League,
                        advocating both in speeches and in numerous publications almost anarchical
                        principles with a geniality which disarmed criticism but never concealed his
                        absolute Sincerity and his intense humanitarian sympathie. At the time of
                        the Cleveland Message on the Venezuelan question he estranged many friends
                        in America by his violent protests in support of England, and a few years
                        later he used language as strong to denounce England's action in South
                        Africa. He was a man of extremes, but every wild opinion he professed was
                        based on the highest motives, and in every little act he practised what he
                        preaches. He declined to insure his life because he said, "If I die young I
                        defraud the company ; if I live long they defraud me. It is betting in its
                        most aggravated form." Mr. Crosby married Fanny. a daughter of Mr. H. F.
                        Schefilio, of New York, who, with a son and a daughter, survives him.</p>

                    <p>It is hard to understand that, despite novelties and surprises it presented,

                        its first production; its many and sublime qualities have since found their
                        justification in more than a quarter of a century's unstinted praise. If
                        there is too great a penchant toward the spectacular, thus to a certain
                        extent limiting scope for individual effort, there is more than ample
                        compensation in the colour, the passion, the grace, the humor with which
                        work is conceived. It is remarkable what variety of subject-matter has been
                        employed and with what harmonious contrast it has been blended. There is the
                        famous Hungarian march, perhaps the most striking number of the opera, and
                        certainly, last night, the be executed; there is the church choir; the lusty
                        drinking songs; the delicate ballet; the Latin chorus, which should have
                        been sung by students and not soldiers : they cannot all be Dick Steeler;
                        then follows the quaint ballad of the King of Thule at length the whirling
                        finale. It is a wealth, a breadth, a sincerity of music that well-nigh
                        baffles description Happily, the rendering last night was in the main
                        extremely good; it was as if far. greater pain had been taken then at any
                        previous production, and the result must have been gratifying to those
                        responsible therefore The front fell upon Sig. Zacconi, who led his
                        orchestra with considerable spirit and earned for them. The chorus too
                        showed a marked improvement and surpassed the most sanguine expectations ;
                        they were, so to speak, trained to the mivat and sang with correctness and
                        an aplom which were most commendable. We cannot say as much for the
                        principals. Sig. Marouli (Faust) was colourless and his voice lacked timbre,
                        nor was Signor Berriel's singing very "simpatico," but his Mefistofele wa
                        handicapped by Sig. Walter's recent achievement. Signa. Grisi made a
                        credible Margherita, but she has an ominous tremolo. The rapture with which
                        the ballet was hailed was quite disproportionate to its merite, though 'twas
                        well enough executed, and the "Silfi Volanti' ' exceeded in looking pleasant
                        and obviously trying. Considerable pain was evidently given to the setting,
                        but the end far from justified the means : one of the waits lasted well
                        beyond half an hour, and we are bound to say the forbearance of the house
                        was more to be pitied than admired. For ourselves, the opera's title
                        afforded us a refuge.</p>

                    <p> I remember him as inspector of the Daïra Senieb. He took with him on his
                        provincial trips a fine black beard-since removed. I remember him well as he
                        talked of the charms of Paris on the platform of Malawi station. Its best
                        cafe, in his opinion, was the Café Américain, but you should visit it after
                        1 a.m. I remember the occurrence right well for later on he acquired a
                        reputation for intelligence. He advanced rapidly under Government, though
                        his family did not benefit, for his integrity was above proof. All the Copts
                        regarded him as the man of the future, and when he was made a Pasha,
                        Gallini-a high functionary at the Ministry of Finance-was the man of the
                        day, everyone's man, everyone's favourite barring " Al Lewa." The other
                        papers flattered him, but "Al Lewa" attacked him furiously ; indeed, no one
                        has ever been more violently assaulted by "Al Lawa": than Gallini Pasha
                        (except Arabi Pasha the present Ministers, Sayed El Bakri, Sheikh Ali
                        Youssef, Risz Pasha, Skander Pasha Fehmy, the owners of "Al Mokattam," the
                        Syrians and Baropeans, Lord Cromer, and M. Hanotaux). But how in the world
                        did he become a friend of Mustapha and a founder of his company? The problem
                        is amazingly hard to solve. Some pretend that, like Payek Pasha, Haris
                        Pasha, and Ferid Bey, Gallini Pasha, once out of office, forgot all but
                        vengeance. The English baye dropped him, and so be pardong Mostapha for his
                        little Daughtinesses and seeks to turn the tables on those wretches, the
                        occupants But I cannot believe this explanation, for he is A very paragon of
                        amiability and-gallantry No Egyptians has a better taste in dress and
                        parfemy for he is an expert in the recognition of the charms of the European
                        fair. Daring pure brief winter you will infallibly see him with one or two
                        of these charming creatures. He offers them bouquets, amuses them, shows
                        them the sights of Cairo. He thus proves his perfect knowledge of European
                        civilisation. So I am muoh surprised to find him in Mustapha' company. He
                        should have spent the money on saying bouquets for the charming denized of
                        Shepheard's. That would have been fa nora reasonable, for, while pleasant
                        feminine society is the ornament of life that every man of sentiment should
                        long for, the "Egyptian Standard” is a tax upon the patience of the most
