LONDON PRESS ON EGYPT. 
So great is the interest now being taken in Egypt by the home Press, that certain London 
papers have expressed their intention to send out special correspondents to study the affairs of the country. Up to the present we have | always considered that the average Britisher showed a remarkable ignorance of this country, in spite of its importance both politically and commercially, and we are glad to observe any : has for long been accused, and to a large measure rightly, of lack of enterprise, and the business man of Egypt especially grumbles at his  hesitation co put British goods on the market here and the restrictions with which he hedges round his would-be agents. On every side we see foreign firms creeping in where we should have come in first, and, though we hardly agree with the pessimists who prognosticate the day when Great Britain will be a secondary or even tertiary commercial power in Egypt, we fully agree with those who say that the Old Country fails to realise what an enormous field is open to her song. The London journalists who are about to visit this country have, therefore, a great and serious opportunity before them, and we await the results of their visits with interest and even with anxiety. The political and commercial affairs of Egypt are not such as can be grasped by a cursory glance. Writers of such
articles as we look forward to reading must, necessarily, generalise and this entails doep study and searching inquiry among competent
men who know the country au fond, as far as that is possible. It is only in such a way that in the articles can be made of real value..
We do not give this warning without reason.About a fortnight ago there appeared in a prominent London paper an article of a column 2 and a half purporting to deal with the future in Egypt. If the writer's idea was to provide the reading public with facts which might indicate to them what the future of Egypt is likely to be, he failed miserably. The article, in feed, is chiefly remarkable for its verbosity, and a considerable part of it is devoted to a picturesque description of a journey which he made to Zagazig and a hardly more à propos
account of an interview which he had with an officer who served under Arabi Pasha at the article there is much fault to be found, As an opening sentence the writers says: "Ten
years ago Egypt was a country of the dead.”.All who have studied this country must know  that in 1896, during which year her revenues totalled L.E. 10,260,000, she was very much alive, and had already made a good stride 1towards her present-day prosperity. Ten years ago her imports showed an increase over the previous year of L.E. 1,271,000 and her
exports an increase of L.E. 568,000. Ten years ago Egypt exported 4,008,000 cantars of cotton, an increase of 148,000 cantars over 1895. Ten years ago the railway receipts amounted L.E. 1,822,000 and 9,864,000 passengers were conveyed by the rail ways; telegraphic receipts
amounted to L.E. 53,000; 1,286 steamships cleared 1,943,000 tons of goods at where the receipts of the port were L.E.141,000. And this from a country of the dead!.

                <p> TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. </p>
                <p>Sir,- In the "Bourse Egyptienne" of the 19th nst., repeated in the "Phare
                    d'Alexandrie" of the 20th inet., under the heading "Bulletin de la Boarse," a
                    movement is said to be advocated by a Cairo firm of brokers and a certain number
                    of local shareholders of the above company, with a view to eappross the London
                    board of adıninistration, and to substitute an Egyptian board of directors to
                    take over the entire management of the affairs of the company, on the supposed
                    grounds of continued friction between the present London and Cairo boards . I
                    beg to state that this agitation against the Chairman and London board of
                    directora does not emanate from the local board, as sach, whose sole members are
                    Mr. Loosdorfer, Mr. Hooker (ex-managing director), and myself. My colleague, Mr.
                    Lonsdorfer, has been absent in Barope since the early days of September, and
                    does not return to Egypt till the 7th November, whilst I personally am al on the
                    strong supporter of the London board in all their actions.--Yours
                    faithfully,</p>
