In spite of the arguments of Mr. Hafiz Awad, editor and proprietor of "Al Minbar," as set forth in the letter which we published yesterday, we remain of the opinion that the newspaper in question must be classed among the immoderate and dangerous Press, and that the prohibition of its circulation in the Sudan was very wisely decided. We do not wish to insinuate that our contemporary is inimical to the fusion of the Sudan with Greater Egypt, and we are prepared to assert that the admission of the paper into that country was not refused on such grounds. It is sufficient for us that “Al Minbar," in common with others, adopts an inflammatory tone, however unconsciously, which tends to excité the native and persuade him that he is being treated both unjustly and inhumanly. It is on such grounds that we denounce the paper as dangerous and, therefore, heartily support the Sudan Government in their refusal to admit it into the country. We have no desire to doubt Mr. Hafiz Awad's patriotism and sin.cerity, but we are of the opinion that his organ is not infrequently guilty of harmful exaggeration, and at times misrepresentation, which is excited by the exuberance inherent to the Egyptian. Nationalists claim that the time is ripe for the Egyptians to govern their own country unguided. Apart from other considerations the impulsivo, passionate nature of all classes renders our assent to the appeal for self-government impossible. Those who have taken upon themselves to assert this claim should remember that bitter words and | violent invectivo are not the way to obtain it.

                    <p>
                        We do not consider that the criticisms of many of our contemporaries, including "Al Minbar." show that equanimity which rulers of a country must possess in order to govern wisely. They have blinded their eyes to facts and would renounce England as represented by Lord Cromer. Lord Cromer has not only, throughout his long guidance of the politics of this country, regarded the Egyptians of all classes with the utmost consideration; he has always been at pains to impress upon European, in general, and Britishers in particular, that they must be treated both individually and collectively with every kindness and as those who have the greatest claim apon the country. It is to him, too, that the Egyptians owe their thanks for the prosperity and liberty which they enjoy to-day.
                        It is apparently useless to reiterate that moderation demands respect and consideration, whereas unreasonable exaggeration arouses contempt and antagonism. Although we differ with those who express their confidence that Egyptians are capable of governing themselves we would gladly listen to the arguments adduced to the contrary. Unfortunately, how. ever, the papers which have taken up the cry of "Nationalism" bring forward no arguments and merely content themselves with the oft-repeated statement of capability. Moreover, the most prominent among these organs cannot refrain from indulging in 'abusive invective against England. Whatever their opinions may be and whatever faith they may have in their governing power, they give evidence of an instability of temperament which stamps them a as men incapable of self-restraint. Take for example. Mustapha Pasha Kamel, who claims to be the leader of the "Nationalist" party and violently asserts that tho time has come when England should leave Egypt to control its own aftairs, And yet on almost every occasion on which he writes ne givgg 'vent to a vicious animosity. He would put himself forward as a characteristic Egyptian patriot and as a proof - that there are men in Egypt who are capable of directing the affairs of state without guidance, Absolutely lacking in self-control hè indulges in hysterical tirades which ar, only go to prove that temperance has yet to be instilled into the character of the Egyptian. He who cannot control himself certainly cannot bo. allowed to govern a country.
                        THE TURKISH SUCCESSION. The French Press is much exercised on the subject of the Turkish succession, and, no doubt, the apprehension that the influence of Germany might be sufficient to cause a devia: tion from the lawful course of inheritance counts for something in the flood of comment lately appearing in the Paris newspapers. It is no secret that Germany, until quite lately, was favourable to Prince Burhan el Din, who was educated by German tutors and inhued with German ideas. But other Powers, and among them both England and France, desire to see the legitimate heir, Prince Reshad, succeed the present Şultan, or, if he should predecease, Abdul Hamid, the next in the line of succession --namely, Prince Yussul Izzeddin.
                        According to information obtained by the "Times” Paris Correspondent, both Germany and the Sultan Abdul Hamid have begun to realize that the German project has little chance of success. Germany, at all events, finds it expedient to havá another string to her bow, Sundry indications tend to the conclusion that, while putting a good face on this partial check, she is now trying to ingratiate herself with tho party that will be most powerful whenever Abdul Hamid disappears. The Arab and kurd clique, now s.) influential at Yildiz Kioski, will be superseded by an entirely different element, many members of which now live in exile in different parts of the Continent. It remains to be seen whether this element, of which a numerous section has hither to been keenly hostile to Germany, will allow itself to bu converted. It must not be forgotten that Germany disposes of varied means of persuasion, and is so enterprising and so persistent in everything she does that the other Powers cannot be too vigilant if they do not wish to sacrifice their own interests to those of their formidable rival in the Near East. It is a wellauthenticated fact that the population of Turkey itself is hostile to German expansion in that part of the world, and that the Baghdad Railway would never have been in German hands were it not for the autocratic intervention of Abdul Hamid. Fortunately, it will require more capital for its completion than Germany can afford, and those who might assist her are precisely those who are most interested in preventing her from becoming the mistress. of a rail highway from Hamburg to the Persian
                        Gulf.

                        EGYPT'S TRADE
                        RETURNS FOR SEPTEMBER.
                        Daring last month the Egyptian imports showed an increase to the valae of L. E. 121, 832 over the corresponding month of last year, whereas the exports showed and decrease L.E. 19,966. From January 1 to September 30 the excess of imports over the corresponding period of last year was L.E. 1,741,777 and of.. exports L. E. 764,738. England, of course, heads the list with both imports and exports, the values for September being L.E. 632,459 and L. E. E02,613, respectively. To'rkish imports amounted L.E. 308,797, and France follows with L E. 221,019. Austria-Hungary | imported goods to the value of L.E. 169,995, and Germany comes next with L.E. 124,866.15 Germany's exports, however, present a considerable advantage over other Continental countries, her figures therefor being L. E. 91,550, while France's exports only amounted to L. E. 71,205 and Austria-Hungary's to L. Ē. 48,595 against L.E. 56,471 in September 1905. For the three-quarters of the year England's increase in imports is L. E. 535,683, and in exports L. E. 462,738, whetoas Ger. many's exports show a decrease of L.E. 163,874 and her imports an increase of L.E. 33,962. The export of cotton and material for textile indastries between January 1 and September 30 amounted to L.E. 10,996,899, being an increase of L.E. 1,339,246. over the corres. ponding period of 1995. A decrease of L. E. 271,026 for cereals and L.E. 385,743 for sagar and agricultoral progace is reported, and li tobacco exports show a decrease of L. E. 28,060. England's increase in the import of cigarettes for the month of September amounted' to 2,947 kilos and for the three-quarters of the year 1,411 kilos., thg total import being 63,779 kilog. Germany showed a falling off of 15,631 kilos. for September and 38,831 for the fall period. France imported an increase of (1.050 kilos. in September, her total increase being 2,851 kilos. and Sweden and Norway give the excellent excess over last year of 1,764 kilos. for September and 2,566 over the threequarter: period. The statistics, however, show. a falling off in the cigarette trade, the total weighit exported from Egypt in September being 11,027 kilos. inferior to September 1905, and the decrease between January 1 and September 30' amounts to 33,831 kilog.
                        THE DISAPPEARANCE OF £3,900.
                        Up to the time of going to press we have been unable to obtain any further information concerning the loss of bank-notes to the value of £3,900 which had been transmitted through the post by the Anglo Egyptian Bank, Alex: andria. We are, however, authorised to contradiot a contemporary's statement that the packet was not registered. A searching onqniry is being made by the postal authorities.
                        A Cairo contemporary remarks :-"Consta. tons à ce propos que les plaintes se font de plus en plus nombreases contre la distribution irrégulière des lettree. Une enquête et one surveillance sévères sont devenues nécessaires.
                        The official rejoinder to this is obvious. As long as the Banks refuse to insure their letters and pat sums of thousands of pounds ander the noses of clerks at L.E. 5 a month, so long shall we have these things happening.
                        BRITISH POSTAL ORDERS.
                        The British Post Office bas issued a notice that British postal orders, sold at the ordinary rates of poandage, are now available for sending money to :
                        Beirat (British Agency), Cyprus, Egypt (inclading the Sadan), Malta, Salonika (British Agency), etc., Smyrna (British Agency).
                        British postage stamps, not exceeding three in number and 5d. in total valae on any one order, may be osed for making ap odd amounts. The parcbaser of a postal order should take care to fill in the name of the payee before parting with the order, and to retain the counterfoil. Remittances to other places abroad and for soms larger than 218. can be sent by means of money orders.

                        Dr. Abbate Pasha has recently returned d from his holiday in Europe, the greater part 58 of which was spent in Greece and Italy, and
                        with big return we welcome tbe appearance 1 of his pamphlet, "Khartoum, Revue après cinr, quante ans (1856-1906)" which has been pab ne liyhed by the Khedivial Geographical Society, ne of which he is president. The pamphlet is
                        devoted to the subject of the lecture which he gave to the society lagt sommer, and which was reported at the time in the "Egyptian Gozette.” He brings out very clearly the
                        wonderful transformations which have taken er' place in the Sudan's capital during the lengthy ay period under review. The lecture from which
                        the pamphlet draws its substance was of more ca than ephemeral interest, and is well-deserving ria of the permanent record which the Khedi via

                        UNREST IN EGYPT.
                        EXAGGERATION IN EUROPE.
                        Every year the Riviera, Algeria, and other winter resorts find that Egypt is becoming a more and more serious competitor, and the beauty of the perfect winter weather at Assodan and Lnxor are now recognised as far more attractive and beneficial than the antrustworthy climate of Continental resorts. - Consequently this season Egypt's competitors are doing their atmost to raise the score of "Unrest in Egypt,” hoping to frighten away intending visitors to the valley of the Nile by brandishing the bogey of Pan-1990 Islamism and fanaticism throughout the Earo-15 pean Press. Here for example is a specimen of the alarmist reports, the author being the w Malta correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph:”
                        Those Maltese, he says, who have connections with Ezypt state that it is persistently reported in the baziars in the towns on the Nile that there is serious adrest, which may become acate at the beginning of next year.
                        The "Express” correspondent at Cairo maintains his former assertion that 420 troops are kept ander arms at night in readiness in that it city for instant service. The reason for this precaution is kept secret by the military authorities. So far'as is known to Earopeans an attack by the natives is not threatened.
                        The way every romoar of unrest in this country is exaggerated in Earope is remarkable when contrasted with the comparative silence about distarbances elsewhere. If such an ootbreak as occurred a few days ago in Algeria took place bere it would have been telegraphed all over Earope. We extract the incident from a "Globe” to hand by the Brindisi mail :
                        "A strange aggression, and one that shows the atterly antameable and anreliable disposition of the Arab is reported from Algeria. It took place in the Bouira distriot, about 93 miles from Algiers. A patrol of ten military police ander a lieutenant was patrolling the native settlements of the region and at about eleven at night reached Bouira, when oat of the darkness they were assailed by terrible cries, and a volley of gunshots and stones, besides being attacked with ondgels. The mob numbered about a thousand, and six of the | gendarmes were hart before they had quite realised the position. They, however, made determined headway, and soon drove off the Assailants with their revolveřs. "Owing to the darkness, however, the enemy could carry oft their fallen, and the police could make not arrests. Nothing is known as to the motives for the outbreak.”
                        "ONE OF THE BEST.”
                        YOUNG EGYPTIANS AND MR. BLUNT.
                        "Al Lewa" publishes the text of a letter addressed recently to Mr. Wilfred Scawen Blant by and dumber of Yonng Egyptians, expressing their gratitude to the author for his recent work, "Atrocities of Justice ander British Rule in Egypt.” The following is a translation of the letter :
                        "We have read your pamphlet recently published by the Press, and your other statements translated by "Al Lewa," and are exceedingly glad to think that jastice has sach strong supporters and heroes who are not afraid of criticism in speaking the trath. O compassionate map, we greet thee without being acquainted with thee. We greet and shake hands with thee because we find in thee the man who fears none but God and bis own conscience. We groot thee because those who seek justice and trath are few, and those who declare their free bat moderate opinion are fewer still. We greet and thank thes because we see that thou hast no equal among Europeang. Thou wert just in thy writings and right in thy criticisms : thou art numbered among the best of men."
                        KAMEL AND TURKRY.
                        "Al Mokattam” Constantinople Correspondent writes that the regalar salary which the proprietor of "Al Lewa" drew from the Tarkish Government in consideration of his attacks on England recently came under the control of the Finance Ministry and will, therefore, in accordance with the custom of that Ministry, only
                        be paid at fittal intervals. dl Oar contemporary adds that this is consid. rtered to account for "Al Lewa’” waning zoal d for the Ottoman Government. At the time of el the Sinai frontier dispute Mustapha Pasha n. Kamel considered Turkey's claims as perfectly b valid and just. Now he is at pains to point y loat that he has no connection with Turkey and is I could never countenance her interference in ne the affairs of this country.

                        EGYPT AND BISMARCK.
                        PRINCE HOHENLOHE'S INTERESTING
                        REVELATIONS.
                        Prince Hohenlohe's Memoirs, the publication of which has called forth an angry remonstrance from the Kaiser, contain some interesting particnlars of Prince Bismarck's attitude towards Egypt. The Memoirs plange into the Werdegang of the Daal Alliance by some account of M. Herbe to, the new Am. bassador in Berlin (1886), who is described as thinking that he could represent a rapprochement between France and Russia as something quite harmless from the German point of view. Herbette, Prince Hobenlohe learned from Bülow, the Prussian Minister at Baden, also wanted to get Germany to aot with France in the Egyptian and other questions against England, but Bismarok thought that France was too uncertain an ally to make it worth while to quarrel with England. France's overtares would, therefore, not be summarily re. jected, bat be treated in a dilatory manner.” There had previously been a good deal of talk on Bismarck's part abort the relations of France and England. On October 23, 1881, Bismarck had said to Prince Hohenlobe at Varzin that Germany most wish France every success in Africa so that her attention might be drawn away from the Rbine. "So long as France had no allies she could not become dangerous for us. We should be able to beat her even if she had the English on her side.” Again at Varzin, on November 7, 1882, Bismarck said that only the Monarchy was dar gerous in France, that Germany could always maintain a benevolent attitade towards the Republic, and that she could "quietly look on when the English and tha French locomotives anywhere came into collision." On October 27, 1883, Prince Bismarck narrated at Friedrichsrab that he bad rocently had a visit from Mukhtar Pasha, who wanted him to use his inflaence against British encroachments on Tarkoy. Bismarck declined to interfere, and advised Mokhtar that "the Turks shonld apply to
                        France about Ezypt.” In Balgaria they should | help themselves, and if the English bothered them aboat Armenia they should envoyer promener the English- phrase which Prince Bismarck then paraphrased into a very coarse one. The Tark saw the force of what he said. On this occasion Bismarck spoke of Gladstone 88 "an orator, bat a stapid fellow.” In Aagast, 1884, Prince Hobenlohe gives in a short note the particalars of the Franco-German rapprochement ander the auspices of Ferry. "In the West African question there will be common action, as likewise with regard to various Egyptian questions, such as the quarantine, the Saez Canal, the Liquidation Commission, andc.” On November 2, 1884, Prince Hohenlohe bad an audience of the old Emperor William, who 'spoke of the good relations with France and smiled. He then referred to England, and lamented the Radical tendencies of the Government and Chamberlain's purpose of carrying the Reform Bill by creating a batch of Peers. This makes him aneasy, and he is afraid that the Republican movement may get the apper hand in England. What would be the ogtcome? 'We shall have hard work keeping our places.' It war, therefore, necessary that at least the three Empires should unite to defend the principle of monarchy. That was the cause of the meeting which had taken place at Skierniewice. Prince William (the present Emperor, 1 who had gone on a mission of State to St. Petersburg in the previous May) had exercised and very good influence opon the Emperor of Russia. He himself and Bismarck bad given the Prince instructions to advocate the anion of the threa Imperial Powers, and the Prince had done it very well.” The old Kaiser entrust. ed Prince Hohenlohe with greetings to Ferry, of whom he had a high opinion. "I was to say that we did not desire a quarrel between England and Franse. Just let Gladstone go on. It is good for ag, not for England." ;
                        THE ITALIANS IN EGYPT.
                        A very interesting work bas just been completed by Professor L. A. Balboni, of Alexandria, entitled "Gl’Italiani della Civiltà Egiziana del Secolo XIX,".(Penasson, publishers). Italy has bad considerable influence in Egypt since the fourteenth centary, when Venice became the great go between for the trade of the Near East with Europe, and the Italian langaage is still more generally spoken in Egypt than any other Earopean tongae. Professor Balboni confines his labours to telling of the work of Italy in Egypt daring the nineteenth century, and his labours have been so thorough that he has been able to compile a three-volamo work of over fifteen handred pages. He begins with the French expedition to Egypt, and takes his readers through the history of the country until the most recent times in the first and second volume. The concluding part of the work is devoted to a review of the present conditions of the Italian colony, their schools, institutions, commerce, journals, eto., and ends with an essay on the decline of the use of the Italian language in this country. The amount of erudition displayed in the work is enormous, and a great many of the facts conneoted with the work of the Italians here are not to be obtained in any other work that we know of. The book is well printed and has evidently been most ecrupulously compiled; it will be of great use to everyone who wishes to become acquainted with the growth of Eoropear influence in the valley of the Nile. We heartily congratulate Professor Balboni on bis magnun opus, and the Italian colony in Egypt shook Iha nwand of nonsasaing ano an aonomnlished

                        EGYPTOLOGICAL NOTES:
                        M. Mas pero has published a report on his recent work of excavation and restoration in Egypt.
                        An interesting discovery has been made at Karnak by M. Legrain, whose name is wellknown in the Egyptological world. It consists of a postern gate with a row of oynocephalæ, whose presence is easily accounted for, as with the ancient Egyptians the ape was always represented as and worshipper of the rising son.
                        M: Barsanti intends restoring the Temple of Goarnah at Thebes, before completing similar work on the rains at Edfoa (the Apollinopolis Magna of the Greeks, famous alike for its tom. ples and the antagonism of its antique inhabi tants to the adoration of the orooodile.)
                        Stelæ have boon laid bare in the course of excavations at Sakkara, by M. Quibell, and at Toukh and Gurmons, Mr. Edgar has dog up the remainder of the treasure of gold-ornaments found last year. 1 Far greater importance, however, attacben to a veritable troasure trove at Kom Sohgaon, which has been onder M. Maspero's eye for several years. Hore fifty rolls of benatifal manuscript, some more than four matros long, were found. | Among these, M. Lefebre has identified title deede, a will and codioil in Greek, and an unknown comedy of Menander, of which there. are 1,200 verson. We are glad to learn that M Lefebre intends to publish those versos shortly. These fragments will onable us to study Menandør more directly than by the interpre, "tation of bin Latin imitators,
