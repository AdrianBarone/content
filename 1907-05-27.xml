                    The refusal of the board of directors of the
                    Credit Lyonnais to allow that hank to join has
                    cFeated a, somewhat unfortunate impression
                    in view Of the important pésition that bank
                    
                    has always held in Egypt. In view also of the
                    
                    fact that it has occupied an official post-
                    tion here as the custodian of the monies

                    ed considerable influence from such a
                    position, it_is considered that the board of
                    directors should have shown their confidence
                    in the stability of Egypt's financial position at
                    the present time by at once giving the necess-
                    ary permission to their manager to materially
                    assist in ameliorating the severe crisis, through

                    Nothing definite has yet beer lie ‘ideas as to

                    Before I left Cairo 1 had the honour of being
                    requested. by his Highness the Khedive to
                    have an interview with him previous to my
                    departure. | have been in friendly relations not
                    only with Abbas IL, but with his father,
                    Tewfik Pasha; and the uniform courtesy and
                    friendliness which I have experienced at the
                    hands of three ‘generations of the Khediyial
                    family would alone have suffited to make the
                    invitation welcome to me personally. I felt,
                    also, it would-be interesting to the British
                    public to learn the point ot view from* which
                    his Highness regarded the present situation in
                    Egypt.
                    
                    All those who heard Abbas II. make a
                    speech at the Guildhall banquet given in his
                    honour on his last visit to London are aware
                    that he speaks English with remarkable facility
                    and accuracy, but I fancy his thoughts run
                    more rapidly i m French, and that when he is
                    talking with anyone who can understand
                    French he prefers speaking in that language
                    in preference to English.
                    almost all Onentals after thirty, he is begin-
                    ning to expand in size, and this fact tends to
                    increase his remarkable likeness to his grand-
                    father Ismail. Another resemblance between
                    Ismail and his grandson is to be found in
                    the moderation of his comments with regard
                    to everybody, even to persois who might, from
                    his own point of view, have given. him cause
                    of offence. In-the years of his exile, when
                    Ismail was eating his heart out from his
                    longing to return to Egypt, it was ‘only on
                    very mare oceaxions, as I can vouch, that. he
                    spoke with bitterness of those who had con-
                    tributed’ to his downfall. In lke fashion,
                    Abbas II., as_ 1 noticed, though speaking with
                    great appdrent frankness, never made a single
                    personal allusion to any cause of offence he
                    might have ‘sustained, or thought he had
                    sustained, during the régime now ended
                    which might not have been repeated at the
                    British Agency without giving © reasonable
                    umbrage of any ‘kind,
                    
                    His Hightiess expressed his appreciation of
                    the services Lord Cromer had rendered to
                    Egypt by restoring her financial sdlvency, by
                    encouraging works of irrigation, and thereby
                    promoting the material development of the
                    country, He thought, however, that thé mate-
                    rial prosperity of Egy pt was due quite as much
                    to the exceptional prices of the cotton crop
                    during the last few years as to administrative
                    causes,
                    
                    As to the military scene tes of Egypt, his
                    Hizhness seemed to me *to take a common-
                    sense view. Without expressing any personal
                    opinion, as to whether he would have preferred
                    anyother solution of the Egyptian question,
                    he admitted that the logic of facts had brought
                    about the occupation. Egypt was too wealthy
                    and at the sanie time too weak a country not
                    to fall under the protection of some great Euro-
                    pean Power ; so that, in the event of the with-
                    drawal of the British troops, some other Power
                    would necessarily také the place of England,
                    while no other Power conld do as much as
                    England had done to promote the material
                    prosperity of his-country. He believed that
                    this was in the main the view of his subjects,
                    aul that, though they might desire a’larger
                    degree of inde pendence at home, they were
                    convinced that, ifthey were to remain under a
                    protectorate, the raw no advantage, but the
                    coutrary, in any change’of the Power by whom
                    ihe protectorate had to be exercised.
                    
                    ‘If I interpreted rightly his somewhat
                    guarded expressions, I should judge that his
                    Highness does not regard any serious change
                    in the existing relations between the protecting
                    and the protected Power as a probable con-
                    tingency. England, asx he intimated, had had
                    several occasions under her military oecupation
                    during which she might have converted her
                    temporary occupation. into an avowed Pro-
                    
                    tectorate with the consent of the other European
                    
                    Powers. He admitted that England had acted
                    in gol faith when on each of these occasions
                    she repeated her declarations that she had no
                    intention of remaining permanently in Egypt ;
                    but he'could not fail to seé that each of these
                    refusals on her part to’ avail herself of the
                    opportunities afforded her had rendered it
                    more and more difficult for her to upset the
                    existing system—under which Egypt was ad-
                    ministered by the Khedivial Government,
                    acting under the tutelage of English advisers,
                    without “incurring the opposition of Con-
                    tinental Powers. Nor could he perceive what
                    advantage England, even if she were 80
                    minded, could hope to obtain by modifying a
                    system under which shé is practically supreme
                    in Egypt, without incurring any direct respon:
                    sibility. His Highness gave me also to under-
                    stand that he had never giveb, any excuse for
                    saying that he had. intrigued or conspi
                    against the British occupation, or: against the
                    authority Of England in Egypt,
                    In connection with this assertion ie re-
                    marked that ever since his accession to the
                    Viceregal throne he had always received the | par

                    therefore, impossible to imagine that he, of all
                    men in the world, would dream of undoing the

                    His Highness expressed in the strongest
                    
                    terms his sense of the courtesy he had uni-

                    attached to the . close -connection between
                    Egypt and England under the virtual though

                    With regard to the recent erisis Abbas Ik:
                    said little or nothing. There was.not a word
                    uttered by him in disparagement of Lord
                    Cromer or his policy. He paid a very graceful
                    complimentary teference to his lordship’s: in-
                    tegrity and ability, alluded to the regret felt
                    at the illness which had terminated s0 suddenly,
                    and so unexpectedly, his long career as the re-
                    presentative of Great Britain. He also express-
                    ed his personal satisfaction at. bis lordship
                    having-recommended Sir Eldon Gorst as’ his
                    successor, and remarked that when the new
                    Conusul-General was financial adviser to the
                    viceregal Government, his relations with the
                    Khedive had always beet of a very friendly
                    and pleasant kind.
                    
                    He then proceeded to ‘eas to me, without
                    entering on particulars, the general principle
                    upon which, in his judgment, the relations
                    between the de facto and the de jure Govern-
                    meuts of Egypt should be based by rights, That
                    principle was one of cordial co-operation. He |}:
                    felt assured. that the British Consul-General,
                    whoever he might be, wou'd have at heart
                    equally with himself the welfare of Egypt. In
                    hig country, as in every other Eastern land,
                    the people could only appreciate a personal
                    sovereign. As the Khedive himself he repre:
                    sented the element of personal sovereignty,
                    in a way no foreign Consul-General could ever
                    do; and he believed the wheels. of the ad-
                    ministrative machine would move far more
                    smoothly if the native and thé foreign ad-
                    ministrations worked in harmony together,
                    not separately and singly.’ All I can Say is
                    that his Highness assured me that, if his ad-
                    vice were asked upon matters connected with.
                    native usages, laws, interests, and even: prin-
                    ciples, this advice would be based on the para-
                    mount necessity of maintaining the principles
                    of justice which have been established under
                    British rule. To do justice without fear or
                    favour was, to his thinking the first and chief
                    duty of every ruler.
                    the attacks made upon him of late by ce
                    ‘English papers was that. they brought apesific |
                    charges against him, and that when he con-
                    tralicted these charges in the most positive
                    and solemn manner, no attempt was made to
                    substantiate the’ charges by any evidence,. and f
                    noapology Was offered. This, he said, was
                    not justice, and he thought British good sense
                    would recognise that this was not in accordance
                    with fairplay or justice.
                    
                    EGYPT IN PARLIAMENT.
                    
                    Mr. John Rebertson’s question regarding the
                    observation of the Moslem «day of rest appears
                    to be rather wide of the mark, perhaps
                    not so much in respect to the Postal Ad-
                    ministration but in connection with the ob-
                    servation of days of rest in, the Egyptian
                    Government service,
                    
                    There are upwards of forty different-holi-

                    or Native and each one of these is strictly
                    observed, If to this is added the Friday ob-
                    servance, the result .is at least 90 days out
                    of 365, without taking into-consideration the
                    fact that in most of the Ministries the staff
                    work only in the mornings, It might be
                    further remarked that on the Sabbath day
                    as known to Christians very many of the
                    Ministerial staff are conspicuous -by their
                    absence, in some cases oe the example
                    of their European chiefs.
                    
                    It must not be suppased for a moment that
                    there is the slightest. intention of making any
                    comparison or other invidious  distinetion
                    
                    between Moslem and Christian days of rest. |
