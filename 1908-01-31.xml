                        history The 1st Battalion came into existence in the closing weeks of 1688
                        when the Revolution had changed a dynasty. Pore most amagat the partisans of

                        regiment joined the banner of the Prince at Exeter, and Littrell became its

                        have sufficed for in 1690 we find it in Ireland in William's Army, fighting
                        gallantly at the Boyne and other actions At the death of Luttrell, which
                        abortly followed the Irish campaign, Sir Thomas Erle was appointed to the

                        of Douay it suffered loss. It was also at Bouchain It was predominantly
                        engaged, likewise, at Pouta Vendin, and in other actions in Marlborough's
                        campaigns After the peace of l'tracht the regiment was many years at home
                        About this time, from</p>
                    <p>1738 to 1748, it was commanded by Chas Howard, second son of the third Earl
                        of Carlisle, and one of George the Second's "captains. Having green facings,
                        it became known is the "Green Howarda," to distinguish it from the Bafts,
                        which were then known as "Howard's" after their colonel. George Howard, who
                        commanded that regiment for a long period. The regimental connection with
                        Yorkshire probably commenced at this time, although the regiment did not
                        receive its county title until 1782</p>
                    <p>In 1774, the Regiment went to Flanders and there made a name for itself in
                        many bard fought actions notably at Fontenoy, where the British were basely
                        deserted by their Datch allies Roucoux, Val, etc.against six times their own
                        numbers. It was whilst on this service that fifes were first introduced in
                        the Britsb service and the Green Howards were the first to use that musical
                        instrument At the outbreak of the Seven Years War it raised a second
                        battalion, which was formed into the 66th Foot, and is now the 2nd Royal
                        Berkshire Regiment late at Alexandria The 19th, the regiment now began to be
                        called, took a prominent part in the famous siege and capture of Belle Isle,
                        outbe coast of Brittany, in 1761; and subsequently was stationed at
                        Gibraltar, whence it returned home in 1771 It went out to Charlestown,
                        Carolina 11 1781, and was present in the wins at Monks Corney, the relief of
                        Port Ninety Six, and the action at Eutaw Springs, and went through much
                        harassing work up to the departure of the troopa and "loyalista" in
                        December, 1782, when it removed to Barbadoen, and ultimately to Jamaica,
                        where it remained until 1791 At the outbreak of the French war the regiment
                        formed part of the expedition which cooperate with the French Royalists at
                        Quiberoni, and afterwards landed at Ostend. It served the campaign of 1794
                        under the Duke of York, and shared in the disastrous winter retreat through
                        Holland and West</p>

                    <p>Ceylon. A detachment of five companies was sent to Madras in 1799, and took
                        part in the capture of Seringspatam These companies were intended to
                        accompany Baird's expedition np the Red Sea to Egypt, but instead went back
                        to Ceylon. The regiment was employed at Kandy at various times, the massacre
                        of one of its detachments, in 103, Wu of the most tragic character. The
                        regiment was employed for some time in the Travancore district, and sent
                        four companies to Isle Rodriguez, which took part in the capture of
                        Mauritins (Isle of France, in 1810 It was also engaged in the Kandyan War of
                        1817 18 19, returning home in 1820, after twenty three years continuous
                        service in Ceylon and the Past ludice It served in Demerara and the West
                        Indies from 1826 to 1836, and in Malta, the louian Islands, the West Indies,
                        and North America from 1840 to 1850.</p>

                        war and earned new laurels at the Battle of Alma where it suffered
                        considerably in the attack of the Russian guds, it lorses being two

                        files opposed to it. Three companies rendered invaluable service in enabling
                        General Codrington to hold the celebrated "Victoria Ridgo throughout the

                        the quelling of the Mutiny, remaining in India till 1872, during which
                        period further bonours were won in the Hazarda Expedition and the operations
                        against the warrior tribes of the Black Mountain, gaining the thanks and
                        praise of the Viceroy of India. The second battalion w wided to the regiment
                        in 183 In 1881 the old number was discarded and the regi ment received the
                        designation of the Princess of WalenYorkshire Regiment Three years later,
                        the 1st battalion was engaged in the Nile expedition, and the subsequent

                        of Ginnin. Two years were spent on the banks of the Nile, and no battalion
                        could wish for a harder time than fell to their lot in the waste of sand. In
                        1999 when the Boer War wm looming the 1st Battalion was recalled home from
                        Gibraltar and rapidly mobilised for active service. It embarked for the Cape

                        Atter a month's hard fighting in the Colesberg distriot the battalion joined

                    <head>ENGLISH COMPANIES IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>AN IMPORTANT DECISION.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday afternoon the British Consular Court at Alexandria pronounced
                        judgment on &amp; case of the highest importance to the many companies,
                        registered under the English Companies Acts, but whose sphere of operations
                        is in Egypt, and whose boards are wholly or I partially composed of
                        non-British directors. In October last an English shareholder in the Bourse
                        and Banking Company of Egypt Limited applied to the British Consular Court
                        at Alexandria for the removal of Mr. Alfred Nahren. the liquidator of that
                        Company, on the grounds that he was administering the state in the interests
                        of the directors. The liquidator pleaded that the Consular Court was
                        incompetent to decide the case. The Court held that in as such as the
                        applicant was a British sobject and the Company was registered under the
                        English Companies Acts, therefore it bad jurisdiction. The liquidator then
                        appealed to H.B.M. Supreme Consular Court for the Dominions of the Sublime
                        Ottoman Porte and the appeal was heard in December last, Judge Cator
                        upholding the judgment of the lower court. Yesterday the original
                        application was renewed before the Consular Court. Mr. Reginald Silley, with
                        whom was Mr. Gooding, appeared for the applicant and the liquidator was
                        represented by Mr. Whitworth. Mr. Reginald Billey argued that the liquidator
                        should be removed on the grounds that he bed shown partiality in favour of
                        the members of the board of directors, such partiality being proved by the
                        fact that he had refused information to the present applicant and caused
                        difficulties to shareholders in the obtention of their share warrants, thus
                        preventing them from exercising whatever voting power they had and 80
                        increasing the intinence of the Board, notably Messrs. Arditi. A second
                        point was that, Mr. Nabman, being a non British subject, the penalties
                        provided by the Companies Acts for failure to comply with the same by a
                        liquidator, could not be enforcer against him personally. As an example
                        counsel quoted section 15 of the Act of 1890, which imposed a penalty of £50
                        per day for noncompliance with the provisions of that section. Mr. Silley
                        then quoted the case or the Sir John Moore Gold mining Company (reported in
                        12 Chancery Division, wherein a shareholder had sought for the removal of a
                        liquidator on the grounds of his having refused information to the applicant
                        and having expressed favourable view, with regard th the conduct of the
                        directors of the Company. This Case went to appeal and the late Lord Justice
                        Jessel, Master of the Rolls, confirmed the removal of the liquidator on the
                        above grounds. Mr Silley furthermore contended that the present case was
                        even stronger than the one cted 'This in the barenbiders 'had in that one
                        brieted counsel to appear and op pove the removal on the ground that they
                        were all satisfied with the liquidator. More over, quoting the words of the
                        learned Lord Justice, Mr. Silley contended that "owing to his (the
                        liquidator's) intimate connection with and favourable disposition towards
                        the Directors," he was a person "onfitted in the wide and general sense of
                        the term to hold the position of liquidator." Counsel contended that this
                        was suthcient without shy morn impropriety on the part of the liquidator,
                        which was not alleged in any way by the Applicant</p>
                    <p>Mr. Whitworth, for the defendant, contended that the affidavits filed were
                        unreliable as evidence and furthermore that the only serious point was the
                        alleged refusal of the liquidator to give information to the applicant. He
                        quoted the case of the Adam Byton Company Limited reported in the Chancery
                        Division), to show that the Court was bound to consider the real and
                        substantial interests in the liquidation, and that therefore the Court
                        should not act simply on the judgment in the case quoted by the
                        applicant.</p>
                    <p>Counsel contended that the written application for information had been made
                        under &amp; wrong section of the Act and so the liquidator was not bound to
                        answer it. Mr. Whitworth went on to say that the case had been bolstered up
                        by unauthorised reports in the newspapers, and asked the Court to express
                        &amp; sting op! nion upon the case</p>
                    <p>Mr. Silley in reply pointed out that the case quoted by the other side did
                        not affect the previous decision because it merely gave additional reasons
                        for removing a liquidator. Counsel contended that the applicant had acted
                        with great public spirit in bringing this question of principle before the
                        court. A great deal had been said about the facility afforded by English law
                        in company formation, and foreigners, who took advantage of these facilities
                        and enjoyed the privileges of Englisb law, should be also made to feel the
                        responsibilities of that law</p>
                    <p>The Judge, in summing up, said that he had come to the conclusion that a case
                        had been made out for the removal of the present liquidator. If for no other
                        reason, the difficulties of enforcing penalties against a foreign
                        liquidator, dealing with assets of a British Company, would be a sufficient
                        ground for removing him. In the opinion of the Court it was undesirable that
                        the voluntary liquidations of Britieb Companies should be confided to any
                        but British subjects. The Court therefore ordered the removal of the present
                        liquidator, but felt some difficulty in choosing there and then a successor.
                        Counsel for the applicant submitted that under the section of the Act the
                        Court must itself proceed to nominate a liquidator and that, pending such
                        nomination, be asked the Court to direct the Registrar to take possession of
                        the books, papers, accounts and monies of the Company. Mr. Nahman agreed to
                        hand these over and the Court accordingly gave directions.</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>The costs were ordered to be paid out of the funds of the Company.</p>
                    <p>Now ensued a highly interesting episode. The Marshal of the Court,
                        accompanied by Mr. Gooding, proceeded to the offices of the Company which be
                        found closed, with a notice on the door referring ballets to the offices of
                        Mr. Nahman. The Marshal and Mr. Gooding straightway proceeded to Mr.
                        Nabman's offices and demanded delivery of the books, etc. Mr. Nahitnan
                        informed them that he was an Austriah subject and would not give up the
                        belongings of the Company</p>
                    <p>If anything was wanting to justify the view of the Court as to the absolute
                        necessity of removing Mr. Nahuan and the undesir ability of allowing
                        foreigners to deal with assets of British Companies, Mr. Nahman's attitude
                        provides a complete justification and will not, it is feared, in any way
                        contribute to allay the suspicions of the publie us to the state of this
                        Company's affairs.</p>

                    <p>I was interested in your issue of the 4th inst. in reading the article on the

                    <p>Writing ex officio, the Government in July last made up their minds to reduce
                        the establishment of the Department of Mines, expressing the opinion that
                        circumstances warranted the strictest economy in public finance, and that
                        the present state of the mining industry in Egypt did not call for the foll

                    <p>The special circumstances which called for a relation came at an inopportune

                        Egyptians themselves recommence the development of the old mines success
                        will assuredly attend their efforts in many instances, but that until local
                        capital and efforts can be induced to take up the mineral industry no very
                        material advance can reasonably be anticipated, except, perhaps, in a few
                        special cakes: this much to be desired phase (conspi cuongly absent in the
                        past) is to a very great extent in the hands of those responsible for the
                        administration of Egypt, and their attitude towards industries other than
                        agriculture. Much may be accomplished by a little sympathy and
                        encouragement, coupled with some practical assistance and demonstration in
                        the more commercial side of the industry, more especially in reference to
                        cements, pottery, faiences, artificial manures, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>Under the general policy prior to the present necessity for retrenchment in
                        public finance, local subjects had begun to take an intelligent interest in
                        the possibilities of the mining in dustry, and at least one local syndicate
                        is taking determined steps to open up the old mines and demonstrate their
                        potential value with the help of a three-stamp prospect mill. Certainly it
                        is the first local attempt; but it must not be forgotten that until the
                        middle of 1907 such work by local subjects was impossible owing to the whole
                        of the mineral belts being locked up in the hands of Buropean syndicates
                        holding huge areas under exclusive licenses. Moreover, the Egyptian deserts
                        were a sealed book to inhabitants of the towns on the Nile; and it was not
                        until these river residents bad been taught that the desert areas of
                        mountain and plain were by no means as difficult of access as they had been
                        accustomed to assume that any considerable movement towards their
                        development became possible. Even the prospectors talds of antold wealth
                        could not break down the boundary between the Nile and the enstern regions
                        with their unknown hardships and tertors.</p>
                    <p>Six years ago bardly a native in Egypt understood anything about mines or
                        mining in fact, it was only by holding out consider able inducement that a
                        labourer could be induced to proceed underground at all, and the few
                        fellahin that could be persuaded to leave the Nile had a very real dread,
                        not only of the hardships of the desert bat also of the danger they ran from
                        maltreatment by its inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>To-day, this is all changed; the fellah has no fear of the desert; on the
                        other hand, be is that in his journeyings, risking death by thirst in
                        departhog from the beaten track, and lacking the local knowledge of the
                        whereabouts of wote and water boles. Among the natives who have been trained
                        on the mines are many who prove themselves capable miners, being
                        intelligent, easily taught, and do not </p>
                    <p>require nearly as much supervision as is usually necessary with other native
                        rade in Africa.</p>
                    <p>Local subjects and syndicates undertaking prospecting phoebe great advantages
                        over their less fortunate Buropean competitors and in their understanding of
                        local conditions and</p>

                        equal expenditure. Local subjects, however, yet lack the reqnisite technical
                        knowledge of mining. Mnch of this could, however, be supplied in the first
                        instance by the Government engineers and inspectors taking a kindly interest
                        in their ventures, under which conditions there are many small mines which
                        could be successfully operated by local residents and syndicates. From among
                        them will be mines requiring more capital aud skill for their final
                        development, which, no doubt, would be readily forthcoming either from
                        abroad or locally, assisted by expert Enropean engineers, BO BOOD as it was
                        recognised that the onus of preliminary exploration and development was upon
                        the shoulders of the Egyptian himself.</p>
                    <p>The public seldom trouble themselves to appreciate the local conditions and
                        circumstances... stanoes of new field, and they certainly have never
                        understood Egypt in regard to her mi Deral industry. To them, a "gold mine"
                        is a "gold mine," and a new field means "gold mines," for the very good
                        reason that the early adventurers in a field must part with a portion or the
                        whole of their wares (usually gold). The old, old story is repeated; the
                        old, old game played to a publiotever gullible when its palate is tickled
                        with tales of wealth It is said that the public learn as time goes on. They
                        do, and they do not for those who learn to day are for ever being replaced
                        by those anxious to learn for themselves what their fathers have already
                        learnt</p>
                    <p>Egypt possesses in her mineral belts gold, copper, lead, sulphur, phosphates,
                        nitrates, emeralds, peridots, and many other minerals of commercial value in
                        her old mines she basa potential wealth waiting for the investment of her
                        surplus funds Many of these mines can be made to pay if reasonably handled
                        and capitalised but the future of the industry lies in the hands of her own
                        people, aided by local as well as ont side capital, and without doubt these
                        latent resources will in due course le developed</p>
                    <p>In addition to the more hazardous side of her mineral industry, exemplified
                        in the nines situated in the desert regions, Egypt possesses in the vicinity
                        of the Nile considerable potential wealth in the development of the
                        manufacture of cements, potteries, friences, chemical fertilisers, &amp;c.
                        Materials for these are in great abundance, and local demand more than sufti
                        cient to warrant their development. Great strides in these latter would have
                        been made during the next two years had the Government been able to carry on
                        the general policy laid down for 1908 and 1909, for not only would their
                        laboratory and pottery works (now lying idle at Edfn have determined finally
                        the commercial value of the clays, refractory anil otherwise, but the staff
                        of the department would have been able to devote its whole energies to the
                        complete preliminary examination of the various mineral belts, phosphate and
                        nitrate areas</p>
                    <p>Maps are now available for practically the whole of the eastern desert, as a
                        basis for correlation and plotting of the data collected for the last few
                        years, and a territory embracing some 70,000 square miles, utterly known few
                        years ago, is now thoroughly opened up</p>
                    <p>It is more than unfortunate that the Government should have felt compelled to
                        economie at the ebb stage of the mining industry, as, in addition to giving
                        a set back to foreign interest, their action in taking away the support
                        previously tendered will ge far to holding back to cal capital and create a
                        want of confidence among many who had begun to take an intelligent interest
                        in the development of Egypt's re sources other than agricultural, finding
                        that they were assured of the best technical advice as the value of their
                        samples and for guidance in their preliminary explorations.</p>
                    <p>Fuel is, perhaps the most difficult subject that local industries have to
                        consider still, the manufacture of cement in competition with it ported
                        cement has been found possible and there is no doubt that serious as the
                        present lack of fuel may be, it is not absolutely an insurmountable
                        difficulty to the manufacture of many products locally in competition with
                        imported articles of a like nature.</p>
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>It is too soon yet to despair of finding fuel in Egypt, for in addition to
                        the oil ares aow being developed in the Gulf of Suez, the indi rations of
                        lignite and coal have not yet been sufficiently explored to warraut any
                        decision unfavourable to their occurrence in quantities suitable for
                        internal requirements</p>
                    <p>The Government are still in poesession of a very considerable staff of mining
                        engineers and geologists at a cost of between L B 6,000 and LE 7,500 per
                        annum, which should enable them to go on quietly investigating the miner al
                        resources of the country until suel times as circumstances again warrant
                        &amp; more motive policy. For the present development may be retarded, but
                        in due course force of circumstances will probably induce local capital to
                        embark in industries other than agricultate Yours faitbfully</p>

                    <p>It is very remarkable to note bow the news papers in England have changed in
                        their criti. cism of Lord Cromer. Last year the Conser tive Press could not
                        be too eulogistic as to his services in Egypt, while the Liberal and Radical
                        newspapers were full of carping criticism. Now all this is changed owing to
                        his Lordship's free trade policy. The "Pall Mall Gazette" for example
                        remarks: -</p>
                    <p>His denunciation of Old Age Pensions as "demoralising," and his conjuration
                        of the working classes that they and their families should be independent of
                        assistance afforded to them by the general body of taxpayers," come, we
                        cannot help saying, with a certain incongruity from one who has accepted a
                        most substantial gift from the same taxpayers' gene rosity The principle
                        that pensions are only for proconsuls is not one that will rally many
                        voters, we fear, to the standard of the eminent and intelligent coterie
