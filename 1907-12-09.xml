                    <p>The Sultan Tombora, of the Bahr el-Ghazal, who is on a visit to Khartoum was
                        received by the Govenor-General on Friday week. He expressed his gratitude,
                        for the kind treatment with which he has been treated, and for the numerous
                        presents which have been bestowed upon him and his followers. He gave
                        assurance of his loyalty to the Government and his readiness to comply with
                        its instructions, and to rule his people in accordance with its
                        regulations.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday week a dinner was given at the Omdurman Zabtieh in honour of
                        Sultan Tombora and the other Sultans visiting Omdurman. Tombora was much
                        pleased with the phonograph which supplied the music for the occasion</p>
                    <p>Sultan Tombora and his retinue, consisting of his son, his brother, his wives
                        and about a dozen servants left Omdurman yesterday week returning to his
                        country. He goes back carrying with him pleasant recollections of his short
                        visit to these parts. He has evidently been very favourably impressed with
                        what he witnessed here, and has expressed his desire to send four of his
                        sons to Khartoam to be educated at Gordon College.</p>
                    <p>The “Sudan Times” says —</p>
                    <p> The Sultan's a very genial person. He speaks Arabic fairly well. Asked about
                        his age he was not able to give a reply ; the Niams Niams</p>
                    <p>do not seem to have a regular way of measuring time. But by bis looks one can
                        judge that he is between fifty and sixty years old He states that when
                        Zabeir Pasha was a young boy, and has no clear recollection of him. </p>
                    <p> Tombora has a large number of wives, exact number of whom he does not know ;
                        nor does he seem to know the exact number of his children. But they are not
                        less than fifty, a number of whom are already established as sheiths of
                        different districts within his dominions. His successors as Sulton, will not
                        be his oldest son, but one of his younger children whom he has designated an
                        account of being more intelligent than the others, and hence more
                        promising.</p>
                    <p>He says that the Niam Niams are no longer cannibals. Cannibalism was
                        practiced by them in the past but on very rare ocassions. The people of a
                        tribe never at the flesh of their own tribesmen. But when a man got old or
                        helplessly sick, he was made a present of to another tribe which would feed
                        upon his flesh, returning the favour to the former tribe when they had a
                        similar opportunity.</p>

                            together with Spiro Bey, of having received a bribe of £54 from Hafez

                            £100 to carry it through Finally he offered to pay £6". He paid first

                    <head>CAIRO OPERA SEASON</head>
                    <p>HERODIADE</p>
                    <p>It is certainly a comfort after the ungainly fiasooes of last year to hear an
                        opera decently performed, without obvious failures in orchestra, chorus and
                        soloists. M. Poncet has evidently, though it is early in the season to
                        judge, made a far more careful and judicious selection. As to the opera
                        itself, Herodiade is hardly a piece for any but the baritones: the others
                        have their chance, but it ts hardly a “obeval de bataille” for them. Perhaps
                        the reason lies in the music. One cannot help feeling that Massenet was not
                        in his element ; he was hungering, perhaps unconsciously after the light
                        timeful satirical ‘genre,’ so apparent in his “Gongleur™ or “Cendrillon,”
                        oppressed, it may be by the solemnity and even andacity of his subject. For
                        a moment he rises to it, in the enrty of the priests, but then again the
                        voluptuous, unsatisfied theme intrudes. As to the performance, the chorus
                        were sound all through, as was the orchestra, though a trifle bald in parts.
                        The prophet’s entry was marred by overmuch noise in the wind instruments,
                        and now and again in the chorus the altos tended to overshadow the sopranos,
                        and produce a slightly crude effect. M. Soubeyran had as suggested, hardly
                        that chance which should enable him to show the best of his voice, but in
                        the dungeon scene (or it should be grotto) he rose to distinct excellence.
                        His artticulation is notably good and clear, but occasionally his attack
                        seems to hesitate. Mile Magne as Salome was admirable for technique, but
                        also rather colourless : her voice sounded constrained at moments. Mr.
                        Vallette as Herod rose to the part ; his fine resonant voice suited the part
                        and the sentiment of the mosic, and he introduced shades and tones of
                        passion and longing with real effect ; whether he will do as well in other
                        parts remains to be seen. Mr. Loiglio was distinctly good as Phannel; he
                        also has as fine voice, full, deep, and true. On the whole it was a very
                        even, creditable performance, without any of the glaring massacres of
                        downright bad singing that spoilt last years opera. The rest of the
                        repertoire which is varied and interesting will doubtless show what the
                        company can or cannot do. We may at least hope that it will be a distinct
                        improvement.</p>

                        <head>THE REORGANIZATION OF THE CADRE</head>
                        <p>The Council of Ministers, at its meeting on Saturday, approved, on the
                            proposal of the Minister of Finance the following arrangements regarding
                            the reoranization of cadre.</p>
                        <p>1.—The credit of L.E. 72,000 inscribed on the budget of 1907 for the
                            reorganisation of the cadre is divided among the State Adninistrations
                            to serve to ameliorate the situation of the administrative and technical
                            staff.</p>
                        <p>2.—The classes of the administrative cadre are fixed as follows :</p>
                        <p>4th class from L.E. 5 to 8</p>
                        <p>3rd " " " 9 to 11</p>
                        <p>2nd " " " 12 to 16</p>
                        <p>1st " " " 18 to 22</p>
                        <p>Assistant chef de bureau " " 24 to 28</p>
                        <p>Chef de Bureau " " 30 to 35</p>
                        <p>Assistant Director " " 37 to 43</p>
                        <p>Director " " 47 to 65</p>
                        <p>3.— By means of the sam allocated to it for its administrative staff to
                            be drawn from the credit L.E. 72,000 each administration should first
                            proceed to the claasification of its employees in the new cadre, the pay
                            remaining over after this classification will serve the chief
                            distribution for a better distribution of employments among the various
                            classes of the cadre, according to the needs of service, in such manner
                            as to increase the employments of the superior classes and to accord
                            promotion on to the deserving employees. </p>
                        <p>4.—As regards the technical staff the chiefs of the Department will
                            prepare the cadre which they judge best adapted to this staff within the
                            limits of the portion of the credit of L.E. 72,000 at their
                            disposal.</p>
                        <p>5.—The increases of salary and the promotions resulting from the present
                            reorganization of the cadre will have a retroactive effect from 1st
                            January 1907.</p>
                        <p>6.—The administrations at presnt regulated by the decrees of the 4the
                            November 1893 and 24th June 1901 will alone benefit from the
                            arrangements relative to the reorganization of the cadre. However, the
                            staff whose condition bas been already ameliorated by previous decisions
                            will not be admitted to the benefits derivable from the present
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>7.—The number of working hours is at fixed at six in the Ministries and
                            Administrations where it is already less than this figure.</p>

                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                    <p>Sir,—“Lex” has none too soon sounded the note of alarm as regards the
                        anamalousposition of English companies in Egypr having alien boards It
                        behoves, therefore, the shareholders in soi-disant English companies to be
                        "up and doing." So far as we know, and English court has no power that the
                        Mixed Tribanals have any such jurisdiction over the members of the board of
                        an English company are free from any criminal responsibility. It is a
                        notorious that, as a consequence of tis situation, many of these alien
                        direrctors are simply the "dummies" of an individual or of a company having
                        an axe to grind. Let me illustrate my meaning : According to English law, no
                        director of a company can be directly or indirectly interested, pecuniarily
                        or other wise, in any transaction supported by him as a member of the board.
                        But, if he be an alien, he can, with inpunity, vote for the employment of
                        the company's capital or reserves in the carrying out of schemes devised
                        primarily for the profit of the wire-pullers whose interests he represents.
                        Might I suggest that some clearer definition is necessary of the word
                        "proprietor" in connection with the qualification shares of a director. The
                        evident legal meaning of the word is that a director should have a real
                        bona-fide interest in the company whose interests he controls. Is this
                        always so, in fact</p>

                    <p>Mr Cope Whitehouse iseveronthe warpath and his latest effusion appears in the
                        “Journal of Commerce and Commercial Balletin”, of New York. The statement
                        that Lord Cromer announced the fact of such a large amount of gold existing
                        in Egypt as “if it were a discovery”, is manifestly absurd aa anybody knows,
                        who has the slightest acquaintance with his Lordship's annual reports on
                        Egypt. The letter is as follows:—</p>

                    <p>Editor: of the Journal of Commerce and Commercial Bulletin :</p>

                    <p>Sir, — In his recent speech at the Mansion House. Lord Cromer refers to the
                        large amount of gold in Egypt, as if it were a discovery made by him within
                        the last few months. But, in 1899, Baypt imported LE 4,678,290, andre-
                        exported only L.E. 1,454,470. The pound sterling is 97.5, which gives the
                        “Pound Egyp- tian” the value of $4.94. Therefore, the net import was about
                        $15,000,000. In 1908 the import was LE. 6,276,806, and the export was LE.
                        1,771,708, with a notexcess of $20,507,093, As Egypt, north of Assouan, isa
                        densely populated country of the size of inm, with six representatives of
                        the Great Powers paid $10,000 a year apiece to watch its finances,and a
                        Ministry of Finance with 356 Europeans, at whose head was Lord Milner daring
                        his stay in Egypt, the amount of gold in the country is more easily
                        obtainable than that of any other country in the world. These facts,
                        however, were carefully concealed for motives which were only too apparent.
                        Lord Cromer refers to the probable release of hoarded gold throngh the right
                        to issue notes given to the so-called Bank of Egypt, This bank has an
                        Egyptian charter, and is international in ita directors, who represent eyery
                        religion except Islam, with only three English names out or seventeen. On
                        January 1, 1905, it borrowed from the Goverriment LLB. 8,967,292 in gold, or
                        say, abont $19,500,000, As Lord Cromer himself puts it, with thinly veiled
                        sarcasm, the bank had “in the conduct of its basiness made laudable efforts
                        to assist the Government” It issued “paper currency” (Parl. Rep. 1906, p.
                        52.)to the amount of (December $1, 1906) L.E. 2,315,889. As the notes of
                        issue were only secured to the extent of a moiety in gold, the bank held
                        L.E. 1,157,694, or say, $5,780,000, as against nearly $20,000,000 which had
                        been withdrawn from the sub-treasury on January 1, 1905, onder the terms of
                        &amp; convention annéxed to that Anglo-Frenoli entente whose mysterious
                        operations have never been fully disclosed. In the single month of October,
                        1906, Egypt imported $28,150,000 withoat increasing its currency by any
                        appreciable amount.</p>

                    <p>According to the consular report issued in Washington on November 1, 1907, it
                        appears that Egypt imported, in 1906, cereals, flour, vegetablespnd fruit to
                        the value of $15,657,845, of which $403,700 represented the value corn
                        (maize) from the United States. In consequence of the deterioration due
                        tothe impoverishment of the soil of Egypt and the practical destruc- tion of
                        the water supply from the White Nile daring the inundation period, by the
                        channels, which have been cut to the south of Khartum, it would seem that
                        the opening up of direct relations between the cotton planters and the
                        United States, with the sale of bread- stuffs for gold only, might securé a
                        supply of at least $20,000,000 during the next four months. From July, 1,
                        1875, to November 1, 1877, Egypt appears to have lost in gold and silver,
                        coin and bullion, over $90,000,000. The method adopted was somewhat complex,
                        although parts of it were dufficiently simple. Any man known tobave any
                        considerable sum of bullion or specie in his possession was “required by the
                        European representatives of various banks and bankers to surrender it to
                        them without com- pénaation, The only equivalent which can now be offered
                        other than breadstaffs is land. It is evident that unless the Government
                        should immediately permit the execution of the Raiyan drainage canal and
                        reservoir so as to reclaim the swamps lying between the cultivated lands of
                        the delta and the Mediterranean, many years must elapse before this resource
                        will be a its disposal.</p>

                    <p>(From oun own Correspondent).</p>

                    <p>London, November 28. The battleships “Goliath,” “Canopus” and “Ocean” are
                        to:be despatched in the order named, when their re-fit is completed, to
                        relieve the battleships“Formidable,” “Implacable” and “Implacable” on the
                        Mediterranean station.</p>

                    <p>Captain F.S. Miller, who has been latterly studying at the War College, has
                        been selected ‘for the command of the “Goliath,” and will hoist his pennant
                        on the Sth prox. Captain Miller is a captain of 1903, and he joined as a
                        cadet in 1877, and at his examination took four firsts and the Shadwell
                        Testimonial. He was a middy of the battleship “Monarch” at the bombardment
                        of Alexandria, and commanded the gatling gun party landed after the
                        bombardment (medal with clasp, and Khedive's Star.)</p>

                    <p>The home battalions of the Coldstream Guards have been laid under
                        contribution for another draft for the 3rd Battalion, at Cairo, whither it
                        will be despatched early in January. This does not look as if the Anny
                        Council intended to disband the 3rd Battalion at an early date.</p>

                    <p>Everyone feels that Mr. Haldane’s scheme is the last ditch of voluntary
                        enlistment for the upkeep of the Imperial Army. If the scheme fail, and
                        there is guarantee that it will not, there is nothing but conscription left
                        for it. It is simply staving off the evil day. Mr. Haldane’s scheme,
                        according to his own words, will take ten years to mature Many things un-
                        looked for will happen in that decade.</p>

                    <p>A correspondent of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (27th) to the “Army and
                        Navy Gazette” writes trom Crete.</p>

                    <p>“If what is rumoured be true, our stay in the Mediterranean will not bea
                        prolonged one. The battalion came here in March last, and has been on
                        friendly terms with those among whom it finds itself temporarily doing duty
                        ; but it will not be sorry when the order comes for it to go East. It has a
                        sort of local connec- tion with India through its 2nd Batn., the old 108th,
                        and it has been so long absent from that land of true soldiering that it may
                        be consider- ed to possess a preference claim. The Mediter- ranean isall
                        well and good in its way, but it has not the attractions ofa good Indian
                        station."</p>

                    <p>Captain F.M.C. Trench, Royal Field Artil- lery, who has just joined the
                        Egyptian Army, is a smart young officer who learned soldiering in the best
                        of all schools—active service. He was a subaltern of the 69th Field Battery,
                        then in Natal, when the war broke out in South Africa, and he was present at
                        the actions of Talana Hill and Lombard’s Kop, and the subsequentdefence of
                        Ladysmith After the siege was raised he served on the staff as aide de camp
                        to a divisional officer. He was twice mentioned in despatches, and received
                        the Qneen’s medal with six clasps.</p>

                    <p>Brevet G.K. Ansell, 6th Inniskilling Dragooons, on vacating the appointment
                        of Brigade Major of the Third Cavalry Brigade, has been iso of to re-join
