                    <p>THE SOCIALIST CONGRESS.</p>
                    <p>Nervous people who see before them an era ht, in which Socialism, and, by
                        consequence, a</p>
                    <p>grinding and remorseless tyranny, will be supreme, may take some comfort from
                        the proceedings at the Socialist Congress at Stutt: gart. Presumably, the
                        delegates there assembled know something of what Socialism means, or is
                        intended to mean, but it must strike the most casual observer that the
                        moment anyone of them attempts to define any portion of the theory, or to
                        suggest how it should be applied in practice, the rest fall upon him as
                        though he were a hare in a kennel of beagles. Upon such an elementary point
                        as the question whether the perfect Socialist ought to possess any
                        patriotism we have been favoured by Herr Bebel and M. Hervé with a spectacle
                        which certainly proves that some human passions have not been eliminated
                        from their breasts. Upon the question of the Colonial policy of the future,
                        the entire assemblage appears to have been reduced to inarticulate howls,
                        says the "Globe" and so great was the friction engen</p>
                    <p>dered that the very translators lose themselves and the amendment of the
                        French</p>
                    <p>delegates in the amazing confusion. This is no d new thing. It has been
                        characteristic of</p>
                    <p>every Socialist Congress since the Socialist Congresses began, and there is
                        not the smallest reason to suppose that it will not continue as long as they
                        do. Something is, perhaps, to be set down to the undoubted fact that the
                        average Socialist is an unbalanced and excitable person, but that does not
                        fully account for the phenomenon. The plain fact is that the moment an
                        attempt is made by sincere people--and most of the delegates are as sincere
                        as they are wrong headed-to apply the theory of Socialism to practical lite
                        its defects become so apparent that its defenders are at their wit's end to
                        save it. Each clearly perceived the fatal defect in the plans of the others,
                        and is consequently vociferous for his own equally futile panarea. Socialism
                        may be, and is, a serious danger, because of what it threatens to destroy,
                        but it can never be set up as a constructive policy in any civilised country
                        until its adherents can agree among themselves. That, so far, they have
                        shown themselves utterly unable to do.</p>

                    <p>What might have been a nasty accident occurred this morning about 8.45, at
                        the tramway crossing between the Sporting Club and Camp de Caesar station. A
                        tram, proceeding towns the eity, came into contact with a two-horse arabesk
                        which was endeavouring to cross the line. The driver managed to clear his
                        horses but in so doing the arabia became wedged in between the car and the
                        Tramway Company's kiosk and there was an ominous rending and splitting of
                        wood, the arabah sustaining considerable damage before the car was brought
                        to a standstill. The near hind of one of the horses was twisted up in some
                        of the wreckage and the animal was extricated with difficulty, to all
                        apparel Shops fortunately, not much the worse. A Woman. Anger</p>

                        employ of the Government. All at once Mlle. A. livid with anger seized a
                        carafe full of water and inflicted a terrible blow on the face of her
                        companion. The friends of the victim fetched a carringe and took him to the
                        caracol, followed by a large crowd. The doctor pronounced the wound serious
                        enough to necessitate a months treatment in hospital. The proces-verbal was
                        communicated to the Consulate and the woman was arrested. Brendful Fire

                        for Foreign Affairs, whether he is yet in a position to give the House any

                        by the Soudan Government, and the possible</p>
                    <p>application of Wakf property to purposes of education.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Sir Edward Grey.-- With regard y to the first Question.</p>
                    <p>The facts were stated in Lord Cromer's last annual Report. They are as
                        follows.</p>
                    <p>A petition for the establishment of a Government school for girls was
                        received by the Governor General of the Soudan in October last. The matter
                        was fully considered and it was decided in March last that a girls' school
                        Ishonla bed , sufficient funds having</p>

                    <p>as explained by Lord Cromer, snch Moslem girls as attend missionary schools
                        in Khartoum receive seenlar education only unless at the express wish of
                        their parents or guardians</p>
                    <p>With regard to the second Question.</p>
                    <p>The Soudan Government expropriated for public purposes an area of 1,202
                        feddans of land at the Blue and White Niles. The land</p>
                    <p>was expropriated under the Land Acquisition e Ordinance, 1903, a copy of
                        which is enclosed.</p>
                    <p>The prices were fixed by a Commission of three at members, consisting of the
                        sub-Governor and</p>
                    <p>two official members, and were based on the</p>
                    <p>prices given at the private sales which had it been affected from time to
                        time of various parts of the land.</p>
                    <p>The whole of the land expropriated, except a narrow bank on the Blue Nile,
                        consists of a low-lying flat which is flooded at times of high Nile. The
                        bank on the Blue Nile is being</p>
                    <p>rapidly washed away. The expropriation was made with a view to building a
                        protective e masonry embankment along the Blue Nile to b protect the bank,
                        and of construction works to</p>
                    <p>reclaim the remainder. The scheme is intimately connected with proposals for
                        connecting Khartoum and Omdurman with a railway and a bridge, and with the
                        eventual erection of quays along the White Nile.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the second part of this Question, the Egyptian Government have
                        on</p>
                    <p>two or three occasions expropriated land 'at e Khartoum North (Halfaya) No

                    <p>or any similar name, is known. In 1905 a piece of uncultivated land was
                        expropriated for a Government experimental farm, and the price paid to
                        expropriate private rights over part</p>
                    <p>of such land was at the rate of LE, 2 a feddan, it but the average price was
                        considerably higher.</p>
                    <p>No part of this land has been sold. With regard to the third Question.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian Government have not confiscated any Wakf property. They have
                        certain Wakf lands in their hands which are at present mainly unproductive,
                        but some of which have a considerable value as building land. The</p>
                    <p>proceeds are applicable for purposes recognised as charitable by Mohammedan
                        Law, such as</p>
                    <p>the upkeep of mosques, the payment of</p>
                    <p>mosque officials, education (especially relief regions edition), alms,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>It would not be in accordance with the d wishes of the inhabitants of Egypt

                        one, measuring 40ft. by 25, is designed to be also used on Sundays, in the
                        afternoon for Sunday School, and later for an Evening Service. There are,
                        besides the school-rooms, library for the children (to be used also as a
                        common room for the teachers) and an office for the head mistress. The
                        sanitary accommodation, provided in buildings quite separate from the
                        school, is arranged on the most approved system. The school is capable of
                        accomodating one hundred children, which is just double the number of the
                        highest attendance during the past school year. The head mistress is due in
                        Cairo about the 25th of September, and she is bringing from England a fresh
                        supply of maps, books, ete. 1. The height of the room on the ground floor
                        slis 4 metres; the school entrance is from the</p>
                    <p>South, although there are three other exits. T, entrance to the flats is on
                        the north side, by means of a staircase outside the building. The - whole
                        presents a very pleasing appearance, and</p>
                    <p>I promises to be exceedingly convenient in every way. At the entrance of the
                        school front in marble tablet has been let into the wall bearing the

                    <p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>NG</p>
                    <p>Larnaca, August 29. A decided change of weather took place last week over the
                        whole Island, and an unwanted touch of freshness in the air made itself felt
                        even in the plains, In the higher localities the fall in the temperature was
                        more marked and was almost extreme. Visitors returning from Troodos
                        complained that for some days the cold was excessive two nights the
                        thermometer having fallen to 36° and 30 Fahrenheit respectively. Warmer
                        weather has now returned, but tempered with an unusual lightness and
                        buoyancy in the air, which is as welcome as it is unexpected | peeted in the
                        month of Angast. There is</p>
                    <p>belief current among the Cypriots that all change to colder conditions takes
                        place from the 15th August, but this rule is more honoured in the breach
                        than in the observance As both August and September are frequently among the
                        hottest and most trying months of the year.</p>
                    <p>A good number of visitors from Egypt and elsewhere have passed through
                        Limassol during the last few weeks on their way to Troodos. Among them may
                        be mentioned Capt. and Mrs. Swift ; Lieut. Grogan, R. N. and Mrs. Grogan;
                        Borton Bey (Postmaster-General of Egypt) and Mrs. Borton; Mr. Adams; Mr. W.
                        V. Vogell, of Beyrouth; Revd. and Mrs. Thomas, of Cairo, and Major and Mrs.
                        Wilding.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Laurence King-Harman, eldest son of the High Commissioner, left last mail
                        for England, on the termination of his summer vacation. Mr. J.A.S. Buoknill,
                        King's Advocate, crossed over to Egypt by the same boat in order to meet his
                        wife and bring her to Cyprus.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Clarence Wodehouse, who for twelve years has been Commissioner of Paphos
                        is about to be transferred, as Commissioner, to Larnaca, in succession to
                        Mr. C. D. Cobham, C.M.G. retired. Mr. Wodehouse has done much valuable work
                        in the Paphos District, where he has identified himself in an exceptional
                        manner with the interests of the people, and has long been regarded by them
                        as a "guide, philosopher and friend." The personal equation counts for much
                        in the administration of a district, and the departure of Mr. Wodehouse and
                        his family cannot fail to be regarded by the large majority of the Paphitis
                        in the light of a personal loss.</p>

                        harbouring a large n number of sailing craft, which has been ang</p>

                    <p>boats from the Greek Islands, which have been n fishing off the Egy tian
                        coast and came over</p>

                    <head> LITERARY TREASURE IN ANCIENT EGYPT</head>
                    <p>(Continued.) It was not however only beneath a statue that ancient writings
                        were placed for preservation, but also in the foundation walls of sacred
                        buildings, for a note added to another version of the 64th chapter of the
                        "Book of the Dead” than the more common recension says of it, "This chapter
                        was found in the foundations of Amihanna by the overseer of the men who
                        built a wall in the time of King Usasphais, its figures are mysterious,
                        nobody has seen them nor looked at them." This rubrie bears every aspect of
                        truth; the discovery is attributed not to any important personage but merely
                        to an overseer, doubtless superintending some additions or repairs to the
                        temple. Strange to say, however, the lost chapter was found under a king of
                        what has always, up to the present, been considered the first dynasty. Yet
                        this chapter, which has been said is shorter than its commoner duplicate
                        which is called the chapter of "going out of the day," is entitled the
                        "chapter of knowing the chapters of going out of the day in one chapter." It
                        is therefore a condensation in predynastic times of several chapters of the
                        same objective import, which must have been selected from an earlier
                        edition, or collection, forming the "Book of the Dead' than any we have ever
                        known.</p>
                    <p>The longer and more common chapter is probably one of these primitive ones
                        which were supposed in their intrinsic essence to have been contained in the
                        short version buried in the foundation wall. Such seribal scholia attached
                        to these papyri, or documents, perhaps upon leather or stone, however lead
                        to important inferences. Was this pre-Nilotie dynasty "Book for the Dead"
                        composed in Egypt at all t or was it produced by the so called "followers of
                        Horus," who are supposed to have been invaders of the country, coming from
                        Nobis or Abyssinia and bringing with them a western Asiatie culture ? If it
                        was composed in Egypt and that so long before the first dynasty that some of
                        its chapters were lost and forgotten, then the predynastic period must have
                        been lengthy indeed. More over this missing chapter, it has been pointed out
                        when it was well known and deposited in the wall was a shorter recension of
                        several other chapters, inferring a still further antiquity for them. Some
                        may decline to accept the state. ment of the rubrie that the missing chapter
                        was found under Usafis, but the statement is always found with the short
                        chapter, and a papyrus as old as the 11th dynasty makes the assertion. There
                        is no reason to doubt that had we copies of the "Book of the Dead"
                        containing this version of the chapter earlier than those of the 11th
                        dynasty the usual rubio as to its discovery after having been long lost
                        would also be found in thein. Also Usaphais, according to Egyptian
                        tradition, had something specially to do with the composition of the "Book
                        for the Dead" and it would be reasonable to suppose that the recovery of
                        this chapter during his reign was the incentive inducing him to search for
                        other missing texts and have the work re edited.</p>
                    <p>Finally the name of the edifice where it was found is of great antiquity;
                        Amihannu "The god inhabiting Hunnn" refers to a site not found in late
                        texts. M. Naville shews it refers either to Heliopolis or Memphis, both of
                        them very old cities; the god Sokaris was also sometimes called Hunnu, that
                        may be because he possessed a temple there.</p>
                    <p>Before these memoranda upon the depositing of documents in ancient Egyptian
                        sacred edifices are complete, reference must be made to a third instance of
                        such a enstom which is to be found inscribed upon the temple at Dendera of
                        as late a date as Ptolemy XIII. There is however ample reason to believe
                        that most of the writings on this late sanctuary are careful copies from
                        those upon an earlier building which the more splendid one replaced. As this
                        extract is connected with the ancient ritual of the Hathor worship there,
                        many copies among the temple archives must have been in possession of the
                        hierarchy of the goddess, enabling them to supply the architectural
                        sculptures with the correct version.</p>
                    <p>Upon the walls of one of the temple scripts which are covered with texts
                        relating to religious festivals we read concerning one of these called "In
                        the coming forth of this goddess a rds Edfou when she celebrates the "suval
                        of the navigation" a great offering is made. All the prescribed ceremonies
                        are performed to her during a four days' festival. The King of upper and
                        lower Egypt, Thotmes, made his monuments to his mother, Hathor, lady of
                        Denderah when he had found the great rule of Denderah in writings written

                    <p>The record is quite clear, it is a copy of a notice from Thothmes III that

                        found old writings engrossed upon leather concealed in a brick wall erected
                        by Meri Ra Pepi. For the document itself we know from an inscription in
                        another part of the temple crypt dated from the time of Khofu. This text
                        reading "This is the great rule (ie ritual of temple ceremonies) of Denders.

                    <head>LE COMMERCE ET LA CRISE. </head>
                    <p>Sous le titre : Le commerce d'importation ek Crise actuelle; le Bulletin de
                        la Chambrė internationale de Commerce publie un intéressant article sur les
                        suspensions de paiemėnt des mois de juin et juillet et de l'abus de crédit
                        dans le commerce sous forme de tirages à trois mois. “Le crédit de l'Egypte,
                        ait le Bulletin, a été sans contredit légèrement déprécié en Europe et, par
                        contre, les exportateurs ne , seront pas aussi larges dans leurs envois que
                        par le passé.”</p>
                    <p>Voici à titre de document la conclusion * de l'article en question : * N est
                        évident que, par suite des moments difficiles qu'a traversés notre marché
                        commercial et de la forte secousse ressentie, il est nécessaire de porter
                        une grande prudence dans · les transactions, prudence qui ne doit pas,</p>
                    <p>cependant, être poussée jusqu'à imposer un "After aux affaires. Nous avons vu
                        presque toutes les maisons d'importation du Caire arrêter les livraisons dès
                        le mois de juin dernier et accumuler les marchandises destinées aux clients
                        dans l'attente d'une période plus propice. Nous estimons que ces maisons ont
                        agi très sagement, car il était à craindre que la crise ne continúât et ne
                        se résout dans une catastrophe générale. Heureusement cela n'a pas été le
                        cas; la crise s'est maintenue dans des limites n'allant pas au-delà des
                        Finances . de la Bourse. On ne peut nier que, par suite de l'abus des
                        tirages à trois mois, dont il est question plus haut, le commerce n'ait étě
                        affecté et les encaissements, n'aient gubi quelque-ralentissement, mais il
                        ne faut pas perdre de vue que ce n'est point avec le gros commerce que les
                        maisons d'importation ont à faire, c'est avec le commerce de détail et nous
                        pouvons constater, encore aujourd'hui, que ce commerce de détail, à part
                        quelques exceptions, a pu se maintenir dans cette période pleine de
                        difficultés.</p>
                    <p>* Pour ce motif, nous estimons qu'il ne faudrait pas pousser plus loin la
                        retenue des marchandises, car ce serait vouloir accélérer la clientèle à la
                        dernière extrémité, en refusant plus longtemps de lui fournir les moyens de
                        continuer son commerce, et par là, amener la suspension de plusieurs
                        clients, L'arrêt complet dans le mouvement commercial est parfaitement
                        identique à l'arrêt de la circulation du sang dans les veines du corps ; à
                        cet arrêt il' est préférable de risquer un peu, mais de remettre, par là en
                        mouvement le commerce paralysé.</p>
                    <p>"Les considérations qui précèdent nous portent à croire que le moment est
                        venu de redonner la vie aux affaires. IL y a lien certainement de ne pas
                        s'attendre aux brillantes transactions des années précédentes, mais l'on
                        travaillera quand même, avec cette différence qu'on saura mieux que par le
                        pašgé avec qui on. peut travailler. Pour peu que les circonstances soient
                        favorables au pays et que la situation de quelques | maisons embarrassées
                        soit définitivement réglée, nous reverrons, il n'y 'a aucun , doute, les
                        affaires reprendre peu à peu Set rentrer dans le domaine de l'activité des
                        époques précédentes."</p>

                    <p> THE CASABLANCA SITUATION. PIANO: AT TANGIER. FLIGHT OF EUROPEANS. Tangier,
                        August 31. · At a meeting the British residents here, while regretting the
                        non-compliance with their demand for a British warship, expressed
                        satisfaction at the French precautions which they consider guarantee their
                        security: (Reuter) | CASABLANCA, August 31. The tribesmen employed new
                        tactics in the fight ón 28th instant. They abstained from charging in masses
                        and harassed the French at all points, keeping them engaged for 24 hours.
                        Perak 31. Paris, August 31. ; The Government, 'in unanimous agreement, has
                        telegraphed the remainder of its instructions to General Drude. 25 marine
                        officers and sailors at Casablanca have received the Legion of Honour and
                        medals. (Havas) S. Paris, August 31. Two battalions of the Foreign Legion
                        have gone to reinforce General Drude at Casablanca. * (Havas) MARSEILLES,
                        August 31. The transport " "Mytho” will embark on a balloon with an
                        aerostatic detachment for Casablanca. (Reuter) TANGIE8, September 1. - The
                        polítical situation is calm. It appears that Kaid Anflous will submit to
                        Monlay Hafid. The European colony of Fez, comprising 'the Germans, arrived
                        yesterday at Tangier. two Frenchmen have remained in Fez. (Havas)
                        CASABLANCA, August 31. The troops yesterday made a sortie without incident,
                        (Havas) Paris, September 1st." The Cabinet has telegraphed instructions to
                        General Drude authorising extension of operations to an area within two days
                        march of Casa Blanca, but precluding an expedition into the interior. These
                        measures assure the protection of Casablanca and the punishment of the
                        murderers of the Europeans. (Reuter) Tangier, September 1st. A panic has
                        taken place here. A special steamer will to-day convey many families to
                        Algeciras : many Europeans are sending away their families next week.

                    <head>"PAN-ISLAMISM.</head>
                    <p>The following interesting letter on Pan Islamism is addressed to the.
                        "Spectator" by Saleh el Khalidi :</p>
                    <p>Sir,- What is meant by Pan-Islamism? If| by this term be signified &amp;
                        coalition of all Moslems in the world bent on defying and resisting the
                        Christian Powers, then the ques- | tion, approached from this point of view,
                        should indeed be preoccupying enough to these same Powers, and especially to
                        England and France, | countries which own the majority of Moslem subjects,
                        and have the greatest political interests at stake in Africa and the East.
                        As a matter of fact, the term "Pan-Islamism" is a wide designation
                        expressing a number of ideas more or less identified with its actual
                        significance, which is that of a tentative desire to regenerate Islam on an
                        "Islamistie" plan. Now this, it must be understood, means of necessity a
                        hatred of the alien races, and, above all, of the alien religion.</p>
                    <p>The grave events disclosing themselves at this moment, not only in the East
                        but also in Africa, have attracted the particular attention of the European
                        Powers to the world of Islam. Even one Power which up to this moment has
                        elected to remain in the background, and tor whom these questions have
                        appeared to have but little interest has of a sudden stepped forward into
                        the light and proclaimed herself the protectress of Islam, -I allude to
                        Germany.</p>
                    <p>Although myself a Moslem, travelling for the past eight years in all the
                        Mohammedan countries, and having held familiar intercourse with other
                        Moslems, both of the religious and political order, having, in short,
                        followed the course of Pan-Islamism according to the ideas of the Khaliph of
                        Islam-or at least of him who proclaims himself such, and who is also thus
                        regarded in EuropeI humbly own that I have never yet been able to get to the
                        bottom of what may be the precise état d'áme of my co-religionists, or
                        understand what may be their true aspirations. So inconsequent are they as
                        to all their points of view in general: that the most penetrating mind would
                        never | seem able to arrive at any positive fact. I must indeed hasten to
                        say that my dear co-religion. ists themselves do not know what they want. I.
                        They allow themselves to drift with events, I. and with an admirable
                        unconcern.</p>
                    <p>All this is the result of lack of education, also of the restricted circle
                        within which they are held confined, and, above all, of the horror they
                        entertain of all innovations. In a word, the degeneration of the people of
                        Islam is at the present moment complete. Were the Prophet himself able to
                        return to this world, he would not hesitate to denounce the Moglems of
                        to-day, and seek to dispel the lethargy into which they have sunk for
                        centuries past. It is painful and humiliating for a Mohammedan to have to
                        own to sach a state of things. I It is, however, the painful truth.</p>
                    <p>Under these conditions "Pan-Islamism," as understood by the politicians of
                        Europe, is a mere chimera.</p>
                    <p>What makes for the strength of Europe is' its unity and its solidarity,
                        forces which are unknown to the Moslem people, but which are among the
                        principal causes of their decadence. The sole results which could accrual
                        from Pan-Islamism in the present day would|| be, isolated explosions of
                        fanaticism in divers Mohammedan countries, but never-I repeat and affirm
                        it-never a general explosion of followers of the Prophet the world over.</p>
                    <p>Further, all the Pan-Islamistic movements which have arisen in certain
                        Mohammedan countries, and to which Europe-still so ignorant in Oriental
                        matters--has attributed so great an importance, will be sterile as to |
                        their actual results. The leaders of such movements do not blind themselves
                        with any false illusions as to the successes they are likely to have. Some
                        get up such movements for patriotic reasons, it is true, but of such, alas,
                        the number is small; others— and their name is legion—for what is to be
                        gotten out of them.</p>
                    <p>Speculations in land and on Change do not suffice, therefore they speculate
                        on the simplicity of their co-religionists,—it is a cheaper investment, and
                        brings a good return. The people are ignorant, and easily caught by florid
                        speeches and by fine promises, while they are incapable of seeing that they
                        are being duped and betrayed, until the day of settlement comes, when they
                        find themselves paying a pretty high figure for their turbulence. As a
                        matter of fact, the two greatest champions of Pan-Islamism are his Majesty
                        the Sultan Abd-ul-Hamid and the Sheikh Senoussi, chief of that flourishing
                        confraternity of Moslems to which the latter gave his name.</p>
                    <p>Soon after his accession to the throne, the Sultan of Turkey, upon the advice
                        of his councillor, the Sheikh Said Abd-ul-Houda, chief of the sect of the
                        Rafai, á society very numerous throughout India, thought of reviving the
                        ancient Khalifa, and thus grouping about his throne the entire Moslem
                        population of the world. It was formidable this weapon he wished to forge in
                        order to serve him against Europe. To these enda | he neither spared, nor
                        spares, time or money. I I am not exaggerating when I say that half his
                        revenues are annually spent on matters closely touching Pan-Islamism. In
                        speaking of revenues I should say that I mean those belonging to the Civil
                        List: Secret missions and furds are continually | being sent to different
                        Moslem countries; rich gifts reach the chiefs of religious sects and the
                        Holy Places ; pensions are bestowed on the descendants of the Prophet,
                        &amp;o. All the malcontents in countries under Euro-It pean rule are
                        received by the Sultan with open arms, who relieves them, employs them,
                        grants them concessions of land, and exempts them from military service and </p>
                    <p xml:id="docs-internal-guid-198110d3-7fff-5e3b-144c-559b069ac4ed">from
                        taxation. He acts thus to those who expatriate themselves in order that they
                        should act as intermediaries between him and their compatriots at home.
                        Turkish diplomátists in foreign countries, although they will not give moral
                        and material help to their own countrymen, yet exert themselves in every way
                        to be of service to Moslems who are not Turkish subjects, and eagerly embark
                        on intrigues with such gentry.</p>
                    <p>So great is Abd-ul-Hamid's belief in Pan. Islamism that at the time of the
                        last naval demonstration convened by the Great Powers on account of the
                        Macedonian question, his reply to the Ambassadors advising him to accept the
                        financial control of the European Governments was that he could not accede
                        to any such proposal, and that he declined any responsibility for the
                        discontentment which would be manifested by the Moslems in the face of the
                        attack thus made on the Khilafat by Christian Europe.</p>
                    <p>Up to the present, the Pan-Islamic policy of Abd-ul-Hamid has succeeded
                        nowhere but in Egypt, and there only in part. Today the entire Ottoman
                        Empire is stirring. By reason of his pernicious mode of government, by his
                        "cruelty, and by the dishonesty of his officials, the Sultan has alienated
                        all, and the temporal as well as the spiritual power of Abd-ul-Hamid wanes
                        day by day. The Arabs of Yemen, of Hidjaz, and of Hauran are in open revolt
                        against Turkey, while she is impotent to reinstate her authority. The
                        Bedouin chiefs are determined to make the Ottoman troops evacnate the whole
                        of the Yemen territory, as well as that of Hidjez and to proclaim as Khaliph
                        of Islam the Imam Mahmoud Yahia, having his residence at Mecca. The
                        realisation of this scheme is nearer at hand than may be imagined. | To
                        repeat, the dominion of Turkey in</p>
                    <p>Medjed, in Yemen, in Hidjaz, and in Mesopo| Tamia is seriously threatened.
                        The rising of all | Arabia has almost annihilated the Pan-Islamic | projects
                        of Abd-ul-Hamid. As a consequence, the sole qualified presentative of
                        Pan-Islamism is the Sheikh Sen ussi. This chief, whose fame rests on a solid
                        b sis, is redoubtable enough to merit the most serious attention on the part
                        of all.</p>
                    <p>The founder of the sect, Sheikh Sidi Mohamn. med Ben Ali Senoussi, was born
                        at Tlemcen |(Algeria). He left his native country at the</p>
                    <p>age of about twenty-four, and went to the | University of Fez, then at the
                        heyday of its</p>
                    <p>glory, to complete his theological and legal studies. He then left Morocco
                        for Egypt, where he began preaching his ideas. It should be said that
                        Senoussi presented himself to the world of Islam not as a reformer nor as an
                        inInovater, but simply as a regenerator. He desir</p>
                    <p>ed to revive and stereotype the religious principles in such fashion as
                        obtained in the days of the Prophet, whose descendant he was. Jealous of the
                        influence he was getting over the populace, the Ulemas launched an anathema
                        against him, which obliged him to take | refuge in Mecca, where he met with
                        the same reception as in Egypt. It was at this point</p>
                    <p>that he sought a refuge with the Bedouin of | Hidjaz, who received him with
                        great respect.</p>
                    <p>After a short stay at Hidjaz, and having | founded the monasteries of Mecca,
                        Medina, and Jedda, he turned his steps towards Tripoli, which he traversed
                        from end to end. While on his travels he preached to the people who flocked
                        to him from all sides, bidding them unite as well as observe the principles
                        enjoined | by the Koran rigorously. He established him</p>
                    <p>self in the fertile lands of Cyrenaica, and there | founded the city of Djay
                        Hboub [1 Jarabub), .where at the present day may be seen his tomb.</p>
                    <p>At that period the inhabitants of the country | lived in a state of complete
                        barbarism, being</p>
                    <p>Moslems but in name. Sheikh Senoussi found| ed Islamic monasteries, of which
                        the Superiors were at the same time Judges and Governors</p>
                    <p>of the surrounding districts, and who made it | obligatory for the population
                        to send their children to them to learn the Koran and to study theology. |
                        Dj Hboub thus became both a political as well as a religious centre, and
                        Senonssi sent missionaries to all parts of Northern Africa to sow the good
                        seed and to found monasteries. Everywhere these special envoys met with a
                        warm reception, ayd gifts flowed into Senoussi's capital: | Although anibi
                        cous, he was at the same time a man of intelligence and an excellent
                        organiser, and instead of squandering the in</p>
                    <p>coming funds, as is generally the case with | almost all other religious
                        confraternities of Moslems, he put them to use in supporting the</p>
                    <p>students arriving from all parts of the country | and in building more
                        monasteries. A few years ago Tripoli, Egypt, and Hidjaz were inundated with
                        these monasteries, while the founder's might and influence increased
                        daily.</p>
                    <p>At his death Sidi Mohamed Ben Ali Senoussi left two children, Sidi Sherif and
                        Said Mehomed El Mahdi. It was the latter who, | although the younger, was
                        chosen to carry on his father's work under the intelligent guide</p>
                    <p>ance of his parent's old comrade, Sidi Ahmed | Errifi, who up to this day
                        directs the external policy of the sect, doing so with the most consummate
                        skill. Sidi El Mahdi adheres strictly to his father's policy. He attaches
                        particular im| portance to the organisation of a sure and rapid “system of
                        intelligence” which serves to keep the monasteries in touch one with the
                        other. It was he, also, who introduced a form of Freemasonry into the
                        confraternity, and who brought about the remarkable solidarity existing amid
                        the Senoussi. | It is about ten years since he left Djay Hboub</p>
                    <p>and settled at Gouro, a point between Wadai | and Bornon. He left the
                        management of Djayhb Onb, and of all the Tripolitan monasteries, as well as
                        those in Egypt and at Hidjaz, to his brother-in-law, Sidi El Madani, who is
                        still living. Two years after his departure to Gouro it was noticed abroad
                        that he had died. Great was the consternation in the Moslem </p>
                    <p xml:id="docs-internal-guid-a1d79df0-7fff-6e4d-53d0-ad6badf6b1cd">world,
                        particularly among the members of the sect. Sidi El Mahdi had indeed been
                        regarded as the "Moslem Messiah" who was one day to Taid Islam of the
                        Christian yoke, rendering the</p>
                    <p>Moslem faith master over the entire world. In Ja word, the majority of
                        Moslems refused to believe in this unexpected misfortune, and last December
                        a letter signed by the chief of the actual sect, Sidi Ahmed Sherif, nephew
                        of the Mahdi, brought tidings to the Mussulman population, as well as to the
                        Sheikhs of the monasteries, to the effect that Sidi El Mahdi had been seen
                        about the neighbourhood of Abecha [1 Absher], 'the ca: pital of Wadai,
                        garbed as a dervish and living amid à flock of gazelles. The letter added
                        that now that no one was any long: er bound to secrecy, it might be made
                        known that Sidi El Mahdi had not died as | reported, but had merely been
                        engaged on a secret journey. This strange missive en-1. |ded with the
                        announcement of the approach. ing joyful time,--that the hours for ridding
                        themselves of the Christian yoke was at hand. The letter was read publicly,
                        and great rejoicings were held in honour of this apparition of the Mahdi.
                        Moslems are actually |</p>
                    <p>convinced that Sidi El Mahdi will shortly 1 appear at the head of a great
                        army to wage the Holy War...</p>
                    <p>Bizarre as this news may appear, it never - theless merits the attention of
                        all the Powers</p>
                    <p>who have interests in the East and in Africa.</p>
                    <p>A general coalition of Moslems comprising the | inhabitants of Tripoli, of
                        Egypt, and of Hidjaz, | Utopian as it may appear, is yet possible. It |</p>
                    <p>must not be forgotten that the Senoussi possess | an actual political
                        organisation, that they are well posted as to all movements, that they have
                        a very considerable supply of "magazine rifles, and that they are aided in
                        their crusade by</p>
                    <p>the heads of the Moslem States, and even by a - Great European Power, of
                        whose assistance the | Senoussi avail themselves, but with whom, like all
                        their co-religionists, they nevertheless have no sympathy whatsoever.</p>
                    <p>To sum up, therefore, every hope of the Pan Islamists lies with the Senoussi,
                        who, I repeat, are far from being a foe to be despised. In my humble
                        opinion, the Pan-Islamists do more harm than good to their co-religionists,
                        What Islam should do is to range itself frankly on the side of modern ideas,
                        putting aside</p>
                    <p>religious ones. One may be a true believer | without nourishing hatred for
                        all others and</p>
                    <p>refusing to be associated with their works. The emancipation of the people
                        can only be won by science and progress. Barbarism and a clinging to ancient
                        ideas will but hasten the end and</p>
                    <p>bring complete disaster. Islam has but to - make her choice between her
                        emancipation and - her ruin.--I am, Sir, &amp;c., a</p>

                    <p>CURED BY DOAN'S BACKACHE</p>
                    <p>KIDNEY PILLS. BI. Mr. Arthur Joyce, 11, St. George Road,</p>
                    <p>Regent's Park, London, England, writes :</p>
                    <p>“Dear Sirs, Before I began with Doan's | Backache Kidney Pills I was
                        positively uriable | to stoop or lift anything,. without having | dreadful
                        pains in the back. At times I have | also had stoppage of urine and have
                        been in</p>
                    <p>such agony that I have had to be carried | home from work, and the doctor has
                        had to be sent for.</p>
                    <p>"The secretions from the kidneys were jelly| like, and at times there would
                        be a red, sandy</p>
                    <p>sediment from them. At nights I would have | to leave the bed many times. I
                        have been :under hospital treatment, as well as under</p>
                    <p>| the doctor at home, but got little relief until | I began with Doan's
                        Backache Kidney Pills. | I wrote to you some time ago, saying how the
                        medicine had helped me, and I write again to say that I am still improving.
                        There is now a regular passage of secretions, and the only thing I notice
                        now is a slight discolouration of the urine, which, I feel sure, will be put
                        right before I have been using your medicine moch longer. Yours truly,
                        (Signed) ARTHUR Joyor." Over two years later- Mr. Joyce said : "I am very
                        thankful to say that I am still enjoying good health.”</p>
