                    <head>THE INACCURACIES OF WILFRID BLUNT.</head>
                    <p>Mr. H. W. Lacy, (“Toby, M.P.” of "Punch") writes as follows to the
                        “Westmister Gazette” :</p>
                    <p>In your review of Mr. Wilfrid Blunt’s “Secret History of the Occupation of
                        Egypt” you quoted and commented upon a remarkable circumstantial statement
                        in connexion with the Berlin Conference, from which Mr. Disraeli brought
                        peace with hononr.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blunt told how, in May 1878, a Conven-tion was privately signed at
                        Constantinople between Great Britain and the Porte, which for a
                        consideration transferred Cyprus to the former. The secret, he said, was
                        disclosed by a temporary Foreign Office clerk named Marvin, who sold the
                        document to the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>. In graphic phrases, with
                        precise particulars, Mr. Blunt went on to record the momentous consequences
                        of this historic infidelity. The Berlin Conference, he said, was assembled
                        at the time the bomb exploded. As a preliminary, plenipotentiaries, morbidly
                        suspicious, had agreed to a proposal that each should make declaration
                        affirming that his Government joined the Conference unfettered by secret
                        engagements touching questions at issue. Upon the Conference flashed the
                        news that those artless diplomatists Mr. Disraeli and Lord Salisbury had
                        secretly bar-gained with Turkey for the possession of Cyprus. Mr. Blunt
                        vividly describes how publication of the news nearly broke up the
                        Conference, Russia threatening to withdraw, France mollified only by
                        permission, arranged for by that honest broker Bismarck, to have a free hand
                        in Tunis.</p>
                    <p>On reading the passage, I was staggered by personal recollection. Mr. Blunt
                        represents the betrayal of Foreign Office confidence being made whilst the
                        Berlin Conference was at work, Disraeli and Lord Salisbury on the spot,
                        con-fronted by disclosure of their breach of their recently plighted faith.
                        I well remember being in the House of Lords when the Marquis of Salisbury,
                        then Foreign Secretary, questioned as to the truth of the statement
                        published in the “Globe,” denounced it as unauthentic, absolutely unworthy
                        of their lordships’ atten-tion. Not being a bird, he obviously could not
                        have been in both capitals on the same evening.</p>
                    <p>Being much engaged at the time of the appearance of your note, I wasnot able
                        to refer to contemporaty records. In the happy leisure of the Recess I have
                        looked up Hansard, and find Mr. Blunt has been blundering and ro-mancing in
                        amazing fashion. The document “conveyed” by Marvin to the “Globe” had no
                        relation to Cyprus ; nor was Turkey a party to it. On the contrary, it was
                        Russia and Eng-land who conjointly signed what is known in diplomacy as the
                        Anglo-Russian Convention of May 1878, defining friendly relations between
                        the two countrie to be observed at the then pending Conference. The
                        Anglo-Turkish Convention, adding Cyprus to the British Empire, was not made
                        public till six weeks later. Signed on June 4, it was com-municated to
                        Parliament in the ordinary way on <date when="1907-07-08">July 8</date>.</p>
                    <p>This concatenation of circumstance makes things a little awkward for Mr.
                        Wilfrid Blunt, in his rôle of historian.</p>

                            Alliance, with an illamin-ated address. In a farewell message he said
                            that England was far more intemperate than America, and the worst place
                            in England under this head was Durham, at least, so far as his

                        <p>Mihali Guidberli, a Greek cafe waiter, recently married a young cook of
                            his own nationality. For some time they lived happily in the
                            Darb-el-Noubi, Cairo, but certain roumours coming to the ears of
                            Guilberti deter-miued him to see if his suspicions were justified. On
                            Sunday last he rose as usual and went off to work. Returning at 11 a.m.
                            instead of in the evening he discovered his wife in the arms of a
                            friend, Constanti Mastrouli. Drawing his revolver he discharged five
                            shots into his rival, who fell, badly wounded, and then turned on his
                            wife and stabbed her. His vengeance accomplished, he disappeared. The

                        <p>On Sunday about 11 p.m., two loud reports, followed by cries, were heard
                            in the vicinity of the Bristol Hotel, Cairo. A large crowd rapidly
                            gathered and discovered in an adjacent road a man lying on his back,
                            bathed in blood and near him a woman who had swooned. The victims were a
                            certain Constantin Mis-trioti, a Greek subject, and his mistress. It
                            appears that the aggressor was an Italian hair dresser who had stabbed
                            Mistrioti twice and fired two bullets at his companion, presum-ably for
                            vengeance. Mistrioti and the woman were taken to the Kasr-el-Aini
                            hospital where they lie in a dangerous state. The police are searching

                    <p>CADASTRAL SURVEY.</p>
                    <p>One of the most interesting chapters in Cap-tain Lyons report on the workers
                        of the Survey Department during 1906 is that deal-ing with the cadastral
                        survey, from which we extract the following paragraphs :— </p>
                    <p>There now exists a complete series of large scale plans of the cultivable
                        land of Egypt, on which the individual holdings are indicated, and data
                        concerning the same are recorded in the land registers. This work is not,
                        however, of equal accuracy throughout. When the location of lands belonging
                        to the State was commenced in 1892, approximate methods were employed, the
                        holdings of private landowners were but partially in-dicated, and no
                        considerable accuracy was reached. The larger divisions of a village were
                        mapped by means of plane-tables, and the holdings were measured and their
                        area computed by the Coptic methods which have been in use in this country
                        since the earliest times. In 1896 these methods were replac-ed by traversing
                        round the village boundary with a theodolite and chain, while
                        cross-traverses were employed to subdivide the area. The holdings were then
                        surveyed with the chain, and plotted on the map. This was continued up to
                        1898, but after that year triangulation was employed to control the
                        subsequent stages of the work. In order not to check the preparation of maps
                        and registers for the re-assessment of the land tax, the province of Menufia
                        had to be sur-veyed by theodolite traverse and chain sur-vey only, but all
                        other provinces were com-pletely triangulated.</p>
                    <p>Taking, then, the period from the begin-ning of 1899 to the end of 1906, an
                        area of four million feddans has been surveyed, as well as another million
                        feddans in Ghar-bia, of which the revision and bringing up to date of both
                        maps and land registers amounted almost to a new survey. Nearly five million
                        feddans, therefore, or abont <measure>20,000</measure> square kilometres,
                        have been mapped on the scale of <measure>1 : 2,500</measure>, and the
                        holdings separately measured and recorded in the course of eight years,
                        besides compiling the land registers for the same area and printing and
                        publishing the maps. At first the scale used was <measure>1 :
                            4,000</measure>, as in revenue survey of India, but the extreme
                        subdivision of the land into small holdings, of which on the average
                            <measure>40</measure> per cent. are under half a feddan, and
                            <measure>50</measure> per cent. more are under 5 feddans, necessitated
                        the employment of a larger scale, <measure>1 : 2,500</measure> was
                        adopted.</p>
                    <p>The lakes of Borollos, Mariut, Manzala, and Quran, as well as the Nile, are
                        not included in these areas. The period of survey is taken from the
                        commencement of detail survey in the field until the last village was
                        forwarded with its maps and land register to the Finance Ministry.</p>
                    <p>It is greatly to be regretted that the public do not, as yet, give more
                        assistance to the inspectors in their endeavours to suppress the practice of
                        demanding payment from land-owners for measuring their lands. Though
                        ab-solutely forbidden, this practice is very preval-ent, but is extremely
                        difficult to check since reliable evidence is rarely forthcoming. When out
                        of <measure>23,000</measure> complaints, only <measure>200</measure> are
                        against survey employées, and of these only a small proportion concern
                        demands for payment, it is evident that the public makes but small effort to
                        put down this practice.</p>
                    <p>From a continuous inspection and the check-ing by re-measurement of a
                        considerable proportion of the work done, it is certain that the technical
                        accuracy of the work is very satisfactory ; that is, that if limits of a
                        property are indicated on the ground the area in ques-tion is correctly
                        shown on the map. Where errors and falsification occur is when a
                        proprie-tor, is not resident in the village. He then rarely attends to see
                        that the correct limits are recorded, but leaves it to his tenant, who
                        frequently is interested in showing either the limits or the location of the
                        land other than they really are. Cases are not infrequent where the owner
                        has not visited his land for fifteen years, but leaves it to a bailiff,
                        neighbouring small landowners have encroached, and if the area ot property
                        is found on being surveyed to be less than formerly recorded the result is
                        complained of as incorrect, it being usually considered that the Survey
                        Department should dispossess any one who may be. considered as having
                        encroached. So long as no landowner is obliged to mark his boundaries, this
                        state of things will continue, and re-survey at any date is certain to show
                        slight variations due to intentional or accidental shifting of the boun-dary
                        line between two properties. Another source of error is when a plot is owned
                        by several proprietors in share without their res-pective portions being
                        definitely located. Now that it is no longer necessary to complete an area
                        by a given date in order that the re-assess-ment of land tax may commence,
                        arrangements have been made for such co-proprietors to sign a statement
                        detailing their respective rights. By this means it is hoped that many
                        complaints may in future be avoided.</p>

                        QUARREL. od SICILIAN MURDERS: NATIVE. News has come to hand of a very
                        serious fight between native and European workmen employed on a building in
                        course of erection in Cairo. The original dispute was, as usual trifling :
                        it arose in connection with the sub- letting of a small part of the masonry
                        work and the actual sum in dispute was 9 matter of a few pounds, yet this
                        trifling matter has cost a man his life. Certain Sicilian masons, employed
                        on the works in question, had arranged for the em- ployment of a native
                        labourer on the work at,a certain figure, part of which: was paid down ¢
                        owing to the tardy payment of the balance the pative, when pay day came
                        round last Sat- urday, protested against the non-payment, but his protests
                        were received with contumely and he attacked the Sicilian. The latter became
                        infuriated and drawing a knife struck his assailant twice, both falling to
                        the ground. It is reported that while on the ground he struck the native
                        again and the man has expired froth the blows. The friends and
                        fellow-workmen of the murdered man gathered round and matters began to get
                        very serious and the Sicilians, of whom there were several, stood in danger
                        of being badly handled. On seeing himself seriously threatened the murderer
                        drew a revolver and swore to kill the first man who approached him, and the
                        first to get near him received two bullets in his neck and one in the
                        jaw,after which the murderer took to flight, firing over his shoulder at his
                        pursuers: he eventually shot himself in the face and was arrested. One of
                        his companions had his head smashed in. Such was the disturbance that some
                        officers playing polo rushed to see what was the mat- ter. All parties
                        concerned have been arrested. ————_—— GREEK NATIONALISTS &amp; MACEDONIA A
                        correspondent of the “Politische Corres- pondenz” Vienna, reports that a
                        large meeting of Greek national associations has been held at Athens, at
                        which a resolution in support of the Greek bands in Macedonia was moved by
                        the mayor, and carried with enthusiasm. It wasdecided thatthe resolution be
                        presented to the Greek Government and to the represen- tatives of the
                        Powers. It protests against the pressure placed upon the Greek Government
                        and upon the CEcumenical Patriarchate at Constantinople with the object of
                        inducing them “to compel the Greek population of Macedonia to relinquish its
                        right of self-defen- ce.” Before the Greeks cease their defensive action in
                        Macedonia, adds the resolution, the Powers will have to'prevent the attacks
                        of robber bands upon them. The Greek Govern- ment must organize the power of
                        the nation “in view of the possible struggle for national existence.” A
                        report from Athens to the “Neues Wiener Tagblatt” upon the Greek nationalist
                        agitation says :—‘“Unfortunately, this propaganda has now acquired such
                        strength that it forms a power almost equal to the power of the Govern-
                        ment. It is the more difficult to combat: it inasmuch as personal interests
                        of nationalistic circles in Greece and Macedonia are involved in it. Funds
                        now come*automatieally from all countries where rich Greeks live, and as in
                        Macedonia those who pay best, hold their ground most easily, the Greek bands
                        triumph over other competitors in burning pacific vill- ages and in
                        murdering innocent persons of other races.” Nevertheless, the report
