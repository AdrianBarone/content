                    India for some weeks past has been read by those who take an interest in | the
                    welfare.of that country with mingled. feel- ings. ‘It is distressing to observe
                    that. a part of the result of the policy which lias tried to give Western
                    instruction to‘all who were willing te receive it, has been to creaté.a class of
                    writers and speakers Whose one aim is to overthrow the Government that has made
                    their existence possible, It is distressing also to see that ithe | | class of
                    writers and speakers just described have attained to a .considerable influence

                    satisfaction to be derived from the fact. thatthe Indian Govern ment has not by

                    this morning empowering local Governmerits to pro: secute newspapers that,
                    publish articles inciting to disturbance. The natural tendency ob ob- servers at
                    homé in presence of sedition in India is to urge the Indian Government to put it
                    down with a strong hand. That is a tendency to which we do not wish:to yield.

                    dutyé of good, citizens in this country is to uphold the Indian Government in’
                    every possibie way, even’ to the extent’ of remembering ‘that every human
                    Goverhment is liable to ‘aul mistakes and therefore of abstaining from
                    microsdopic criticism of its action’’ One of the chief difficulties of any
                    Govern- ment, which like that of Great Britain is orgenised upon democratic
                    principles in so far - that it is responsible to-n Parliament, is that in

                    different society and speech from our own, there is always the possibility of

                    or other acts of the Government, persons ata distance may infer that this
                    country is divided and drsiors has no strong ‘will. Such an impréssion, if it
                    should be produced or encouraged in India just now, would be most unfortunate,

                    Viceroy of India appointed by the late Government :has the confidence of their
                    snccessors. It is fortunate that the res- ponsibility to. Parliament for the
                    government of India is in the hands of Mr Morley, in - whose character and
                    ability both partios have complete confidence. There are, ‘of ‘course, many who
                    do not agree with sdme of Mr, Morley’s political theories, theories which we +
                    have often had. oecasion to’ criticise, But Mr. Morley id a worker, a great

                    case of a failtire to grasp the nature. of a situation, or of a weakness in

                    overthrow of the British Government as soon ‘as possible, by the plan of passive

                    Mustapha Pasha Kamel appears to be very’ greatly enraged by the granting of the
                    freedom of the City of London to Lord. Cromer asa mark’of the high esteem in
                    whicli his work in Egypt is ‘held at home. Ina remarkable and amusing article
                    the “Egyptian - ird” takes Reuter’s Agency and the pondents of the Occupation
                    Press to ia for having emphasised the honour and significance of such a
                    conferment. The same paper insinuates that no mention was made of a similar
                    conferment on Lord Lister, but we humbly beg to refer the. writer of the article
                    in, question to the issue of the “Egyptian Gazette” of Thorsday the 6th inst.
                    The repro- duetion of the article will give further proof to our readers abroad
                    that Mustapha Kamel can hardly be actuated in his writings by a reasonable
                    spirit, for no reason for such an outburst of rage could be offered by any of
                    his supporters. It is: somewhat amusing that the artidle insists upon the
                    omission of Lord Lister's namein the telegram announcing the honour to Lord
                    Cromer as being wilful, where- as the heading 1eads “careless omission,” We
                    might also remark that Mustapha Kamel has at times taken pains to point out that
                    it was only Lord Cromer’s policy which he attacked, while this article shows
                    extreme personal venom. The following is the text in extenso:— “It will be
                    remembered what a fuss was made over Lord Cromer’s being offered the freedom of
                    the City of London. “Reuter’s Agency and the correspondents of the Occupation
                    papers wired in magnificent enthusiastic terms, the glorious news of the
                    unparalleled honou conferred upon the great Earl of Cromer by the stupifying
                    generosity of the City Corporation. “And Cromerites were thunderstruck. They
                    remained bouche-bes. They gushed all over with pride and felt
                    patriotic-——-Cro-merrily’ pa- triotic—and cheered the, ex-pro-Consul and praised
                    the Lord that they were Imperialists “But what neither Reuter’s Agency nor the
                    correspondents of the Occupation papers stated —they even shunned it as doth a
                    mule a tin- can—was that Lord Cromer:was not the only Lord whom it was proposed
                    to hononr in the way. “Of course they did not state so. It would have detracted
                    from the importance of the unparallelism, which they wished to impress upon the
                    Egyptians. “So naturally, with the remarkably fine, gentlernanly sense of
                    impartiality which cha- racterises the Imperialist bogey press, they left the
                    other Lord out in the cold, and passed over the honor conferred upon him with
                    com- prehensible though not exactly justifiable disdain, “Who was the other Lord
                    ? “Ps — Lord Lister—a somebody, perhaps a nobody in Cromerite eyes, but. still a
                    greater man thar the Earl of Cromer was the genius whom the City Corporation
                    offered in the first place, thie freedom of the City of London. “Tt is/excusable
                    perhaps, this omission on the part of Reuter’s Agency and.the correspondents of
                    the Imperislist, justice-loving press. Because, blinded by: their fatuity for
                    Lord Cromer, they ignore the existence of all other Lords. “We are sorry to-day
                    to have to throw a backet of cold water upon their rejoicing and at the same
                    time to reveal to the impartial members of Egyptian society to what moral
                    extremes the Imperialist press can go when bent upon furthering imperialism
                    regardless of the colour or nature of the means they employ. “Lord Lister, with
                    Guthrie and Pasteur one of the greatest ‘saviours of humanity; Lord Lister, the
                    propagator ‘of antiseptic surgery ; Lord Lister the eminent surgeon who had
                    saved the lives of thousands, hundreds of thonsands of doomed invalids and_
                    sufferers ; Lord Lister—well Lord Lister dwindled away ‘at-the shadow of nothing
                    beside the gigantic hero of Denshawai, beside the man who would not’commutate an
                    unjust death sentence, who officially insulted the religion of three hundred
                    million souls as might have done a fanatic missionary. “Dwindles away to
                    nothing/Ab, time will say ! : “'o-day, and inspite of Reuter’s agency and the
                    correspondents of the’ Occupation press, the gratitude of milions repays Lord
                    Lister for his deeds, whereas a few stock-brokers, bondholders speculators,
                    financiers and ¢a- pitalists—together with their officially trampet- press
                    organs—are the only grateful debtors of the Earl of Cromer. “And to think that
                    the /reédom of a city has been given to a man who has become eminent in
                    Imperialist arenas because he refused to give freedom toa country! Itis the non

                    many of the local newspapers, the public attendance was enormous at the second

                    before the French Consul, Mr. Paul de Reffye, who was assisted in his difficult
                    task by Messrs: Favenc and’ Bianchi, After many witnesses had been called,
                    Maitre Widal, counsel for the plaintif rose, and, in the course of « lengthy
                    address, eloquently referred to the evils and discomforts. attribut- able to
                    hasty tempers. He further pointed out that, the-opprobrious and insulting terms,
                    which his client, Mr. Cheki-Ganem, is alleged to have used towards the
                    defendant, were tot proyed, and that according to the evidenoe, no, provocation
                    whatever had been given to justify so brutal an attack. During his M. Widal
                    frequently appealed with great. ex- citement to the President, for the of the
                    Tribunal, stating that it was quite possible for him to proceed, while the
                    defendant was permitted to insult him, The. President, however, was unable to
                    admit thatany cause for complaint had been established and held that the case
                    must continue.. M. Widal, who was evidently much upset by this contretemps, soon
                    after took his seat. In reply to M. Widal, M. Guithaumon delivered a stirring
                    defence. He related in detail and, with many humorous remarks, the scene which
                    ocedrred’ at the theatre, and expressed his hearty approval'of the manly way in
                    which his client, at last goaded beyond endurance, had endeavoured to .put a
                    stop to the insinuations and abuse to which he and his wife had been exposed. He
                    then proposed to read a letter to the Court, which Mr. Ganem had written in
                    April last to Mme. Lechat, but, by request of she plaintif, who objected on the
                    grounds that he did not desire the members of his family to be dragged into the
                    case, the President ordered the letter to be withdrawn. In short, M. Guilhaumen
                    pleaded: great o vocation and suggestted that his client’s tions were, under the
                    circumstances, justifiable M. Padoa then replied in a few well chosen words,
                    and, after much heated - discussion between counsell the case was eventually

                    Correspondent of the Times,” dated September 7, 1897.) ’, This morning saw
                    Alexandria endowed; with an ‘interesting monument, a relic of the Ptolemaic
                    days. About 20 years ago there ‘| was discovered in the grounds of a Jewii
                    school ‘the shaft of a large handséme rosé’ granite column ; this was presented
                    to the Municipality by Baron Jacques Menasce but no use was made of it until
                    quite recently. Dr. Schiess Bey, director of the Government, hos- pitol, offered
                    to erect it on a prominent site ae ae from which it is’ visible far out to sea,
                    u himself the responsi- bility for all viske a _ By good fortane his excavations
                    resulted in fi the capital almost uninjured at 30ft. distance from the shaft,
                    The length of shaft is over 34 ft. witha diameter of 8} feet and weight 70 tons.
                    ‘The base, a separate piece, is 2 feet 4 inchesin height, by 5ft. Sin. diameter,
                    and the capital, which consists of two pieces, is 4ft. Gin. in height by 7ft. 9
                    in. diagonai breadth. One side of it is.not carved, but has cuts made for
                    inserting metal cramps, as thoggh it’ were originally attached to a building,
                    the capital gonsiderably overhanging the base of the column. The monument when
                    completed will measure 55ft. 7in. from the ground to the summit. The column is
                    believed to have belonged to the temple of Saturn which early in the fourth
                    century was transformed into the:church of St. Michael. The following
                    inscription is on a scroll deposited in the pedestal of gray stone built. to
                    support the column. ; “This colamn was erected in commemoration of the fall of
                    Omdurman and Khartum (Sept. 2 1898) a victory won by-the troops of Victoria,
                    Queen,and Empress, fighting side by side with the soldiers of Abbas Hilmy,
                    Khedive of Egypt. The gloriows success of the combined troops under General
                    Kitchener, Sirdar of the Egyptian Army, resulting in the reconquest of, the
                    Sudan and. the avenging of the death of Gordon Pasha, was rendered possible by
                    the prosperity of Egypt, chiefly due to the wise counsels of the English
                    Minister Plenipo- tentiary, Lord Cromer, and the hearty co- operation of English
                    and Egyptian officials, Signed by Ronald B. Lane, Major-General Ambrose Ralli,

                    worthily crown the column, and Ihave been asked to. bring the suggestion to the
                    notice of the friends of the late.General in the hope that they will approve of
                    it and further it’s execution, as there is no monument to his memory in this
                    country, for which he did so much and finally gave his life. Another monoment,
                    also due to the initia tive of Dr. Schiess, is a beautifnl white marble column
                    with a composite capital of green granite which he discovered during his ex-
                    cavations in ground belonging to the Hibspital. This column he erected in 1897
                    to commem- orate the Queen’s jubilee ; it stands on and sea, and.bears on “the
                    pedestal the following inscription ; Victoriae Britt. Reg. Fid. Def. _ Ind. Imp.
                    IVN. XXII A.D. Mopceexe VII. Jt seems apity that the learned societies of
                    England display little or no interest .in the Greek and Roman antiquities of
                    Alexandria and the neighbourhood, where very much of great value still remains
                    buried. The city museum now contains a highly interesting collection, which,
                    however, bunt few travellers stay to visit. Nota Bene. It seems strange that
                    Schiess Pasha should have on two occasions this shown his appreciation of the
                    British rule in country, by erecting two columns at his own expense in this
                    city, and yet has never received any token from the British au- thorities, here
                    or in Downing Street, of these generous actions. We feel positive that if H.M.
                    King Edward VIII was aware of such apparent ingratitude on the part of the
                    British com- munity and of the Powers that be, His Majesty himself would rectify
                    the oversight. eR TEI CREA ETT TI ALEXANDRIA SPORTING CLUB. —-—— FOURTH SUMMER
                    MEETING. Excellent weather favored the second day's racing of the Fourth Summer
                    Meeting and the attendance ‘was one of the best and most fashionable we have
                    seen this season. Amongst those present we noticed Sir Eldon Gorst, Sir William
                    Garstin, Rear Admiral Sir Massie and Lady Blomfield, Borton Bey, Hopkinson Bey
                    and the Hon. Mrs. Hopkinson. Racing and betting were keen, the chief interest of
                    ‘the afternoon being centred upon the Summer Handicap for which fifteen. runners
                    went to the post and the Mahmoudieh Cup which brought out Carlton and Aurelius
                    meeting at only a difference of 8.Jbs, and it was generally anticipated that the
                    former would reverse the result of Thursday's running, but he was not game
                    enough and Aurelius-won comfortably. The Band,of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers
                    under the conduetorship of Band- master A. Fawcetéplayed during the afternoon.
