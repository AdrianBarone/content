                        Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel accommodation
                        for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr. Najem Houry
                        proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent
                        Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to
                        Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
                        Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                        Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                        begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                        Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                        scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                        in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                        <head>THE SITUATION IN INDIA.</head>
                        <p> "Mr. Morley described the Indian situation quite accurately," says the
                            “Spectator,” ''when he said that the Government of the Punjab, by
                            prohibiting seditious meetings, bad allayed excitement in that great
                            province, but that there was still anxiety there,' and, he might have added,
                            throughout India. The seriousness of the situation, indeed, becomes clearer
                            and clearer. It is impossible to read the telegrams which stream in almost
                            day by day, with their accounts of incidents in Eastern Bengal and the
                            Panjab and their translations from native papers everywhere, without
                            perceiving that the class of educated natives which we have created, baffled
                            in their ambitions, and with a new consciousness of their capacity, have
                            decided that the only way to the realisation of their hopes lies through the
                            overthrow of the British Government and the substituting for it of a
                            Government, or many Governments, entirely native ; and to secure this end
                            they are endeavouring, first of all, to excite the masses of the people by
                            pouring our torrents of calumny, and secondly, to incite the native troops,
                            and more especially the Sikhs, who are dreaded throughout India, to overt
                            mutiny."</p>
                        <p>"To quit India and that, and nothing else, is the demand made on us-would be
                            to abandon three hundred millions of people for whom we are morally trustees
                            to all the evils of anarchy, without securing to them any of the advantages
                            of independence. They do not perceive it, but it is a certainty that the
                            withdrawal of Great Britain would be followed almost instantly by a
                            partition of India among the Great Powers, both of Europe and Asia, who
                            would spring at once-France upon Barma and Eastern Bengal, Russia upon the
                            Northern Provinces, Germany upon Bombay and its hinterland, and China
                            through Nepal upon Bengal proper, which they would regard as grand prizes,
                            securing to them revenue and the monopoly of the vast markets for which they
                            are all hangering. It is simply impossible for us to destroy in this way our
                            own prestige, and to upset the general order of the world without any reason
                            which can appeal either to our interests, our consciences, or our conviction
                            that there are races in the world which are still in the position of minors,
                            who must until they are full-grown be guided by other brains than their
                            own."</p>
                        <p>"The most mysterious question in the whole movement, which puzzles, and to a
                            certain extent dismays, the most experienced AngloIndians, is why it should
                            have occurred at the present moment. An electric vibration is evidently
                            passing over the peninsula, but its cause is absolutely invisible. The
                            Government has done nothing good or bad that should rouse the people to
                            resistance. There have perhaps, been blunders in the collection of the Land
                            tax in the Punjab; but the movement is not confined to the Punjab, and
                            Bengal is under the Perpetual Settlement. Neither the masses | nor the
                            soldiery care one straw whether the alumni of the Colleges are provided for
                            by the State or are left to find incomes by their own exertions. Indeed, one
                            most remarkable feature of the whole movement is the absence of any definite
                            grievance the removal of which would at once conciliate opinion. That India
                            shared in the mental shock produced throughout Asia by the victories of the
                            Japanese is undoubtedly true, and is acknowledged by every experienced
                            official; but the Japanese are bound to the British Government by the
                            strongest of all ties-a necessity for assistance if they are attacked by sea
                            in their home waters and by a combination of Powers. The discontent has, in
                            fact, manifested itself like a subterranean force which suddenly shatters
                            cities, yet leaves the citizens powerless to explain, or even to understand,
                            the oommotion. In 1857 the insurgents in their letters to each other made
                            much of the fact that the British garrison had been reduced to its lowest
                            point; but the garrison in India in 1907 never was so strong. There will be
                            an explanation by and by; but for the present we have only to acknowledge a
                            grave danger, and face it as our countrymen faced it fifty years ago,
                            without fear, without cruelty, and without hesitation as to the rectitude of
                            our decision to continue ruling."</p>

                        some time living in the tomb of Rameses IV.. he said he noticed on a wall
                        the following inscription by a Greek tourist of antiquity : "I have come
                        here, but I see nothing to admire at all-except the big stone." People of
                        the old days were very much like those of the present day, and like them

                    <head> A Nationalist Journalist.</head>
                    <p>Much comment has been aroused in Cairo owing to the assault made on a
                        European journalist, belonging to a Cairo Nationalist European morning
                        newspaper. This person was assaulted on Thursday evening on leaving the
                        Garden Theatre by a Spaniard belonging to the troupe. The Spaniard says the
                        "Journal du Caire," resented the assiduous attentions, which the nationalist
                        journalist lavished on an artiste. Our French contemporary entitles 'the
                        affair "Un Incident Passionnel” and declares that the journalist was
                        brutally attacked. The combatants used their sticks and fista, but were
                        separated before they had hurt one another seriously.</p>

                    <p>The Director General of Quarantine at Port Said has telegraphed the following
                        particulars of a suspected case of plague discovered on board a British
                        8.S., "Othello" :-The "Othel. lo" on arriving at Port Said from Hull
                        disembarked a cooks mate, who has been ill for the past three days, and
                        shows symptoms of plague; he has been transferred to the local lazaret and
                        the necessary steps have been taken to isolate the possibly infected vessel,
                        which has entered the canal in quarantine. Dr. Zirola has been charged with
                        the bacteriological examination of the suspected case. The ship and crew
                        were then medically inspected, with the result that a carpenter, who also
                        shows symptoms of the disease, has been brought ashore.</p>

                    <p>Continuing our reference to the report of Dr. Gostchlich on the Sanitary
                        Services of the Municipality, we turn to his remarks on the work done by the
                        Bureau des Meurs". The control exercised by this bureau is of great public
                        importance, but, as Dr. Gostchlich points out, any really efficient
                        supervision is im| possible among Europeans, firstly we should say, on
                        account of the laxity of the regulations necessitated by the Capitulations,
                        and secondly owing to the continual movement from one place to another and
                        from this town to others of Egypt and abroad. The statistics given by the
                        director of the Sanitary Services show that the proportion of diseased
                        persons under observation is alarmingly high, the percentages for 1906 being
                        45 among natives and 30 among Europeans, as compared with the respective
                        average percentages of 36 and 21 for the triennial period of 1903 to
                        1905.</p>
                    <p>We append Dr. Gntschlich's report on this service:-</p>
                    <p>"Les résultats obtenus par la surveillance des filles publiques, me font le
                        devoir de répéter ce que j'ai déjà exposé dans mon rapport préc. dent au
                        sujet des défectuosités du système actuel de contrôle; je dois y revenir
                        cette année-ci d'autant plus que la | fréquence des maladies vénériennes en
                        1906 était de nouveau plus élevée que pendant les années précédentes. Cela
                        tient surtout à ce que les femmes publiques, surtout celles appartenant à
                        des nationalités étrangères, constituent ici une population éminemment
                        fluctuante, de façon qu'un contrôle permanent -- la base de toute
                        amélioration durable -- devient très difficile sinon impossible. On peut
                        s'en rendre compte erf constatant que le nombre des filles ayant été sous
                        observation ininterrompue depuis 1901 (date de l'organisation du bureau des
                        maurs) ne forme qne la moitié environ du total existant pour les indigènes
                        et même seulement les 10 % à peine pour les européennes. Chez ces dernières
                        le mouvement annuel des filles entrées nouvellement et rayées pendant
                        l'année est tel, qu'en 2 ans tout ce personnel est complètement changé !
                        Dans des conditions pareilles, l'on ne peut demander l'impossible d'un
                        simple contrôle sanitaire et tout ce que nous pouvons faire c'est de
                        soumettre tous les cas de maladies vénériennes constat's parmi les filles, à
                        un traitement d'hôpital énergique."</p>
                    <p>DRINKING WATER SUPPLY.-Dr. Gotschlich next deals with the drinking water
                        supply of Alexandria. The Jewel filters which are in use continue to work to
                        the entire satisfaction of the sanitary authorities. As regards the
                        clarification of water coming from the filters, it is declared that this is
                        almost always of perfect limpidity. In spite of the fact that the water
                        straight from the Mabmoudieh canal is sometimes so disturbed that one can
                        distinguish nothing through a bed of only one centimetre's depth, the
                        filtered water almost invariably is transparent up to and beyond 200 cm. The
                        water from each filter is examined daily from the point of view of
                        transparency, and it was only on nine occasions that the figure was inferior
                        to the above. Even on those days, however, when the limpidity of the water
                        was below normal, the quality of the water has always been irreproachable
                        from a bacteriologi. cal point of view. The monthly average of the number of
                        bacteria in one cubic centimetre of filtered water never exceeded 27, while
                        the number of bacteria in the equivalent quantity of unfiltered water was
                        about 4,700, whilst the highest figure reached for filtered water was 67,
                        which shows an excellent comparison with more than 19,000 in unfiltered
                        water. The filters are cleaned twice a week in the presence of sanitary
                        inspectors, and it is notable that fifteen minutes after having been cleaned
                        they invariably recovered their normal efficacy. Dur. ing 1906 there were
                        18,483 subscribers to the filtered water in town and 27 in Ramleh, with a
                        daily water supply of 32,100 cubic metres, as compared with 29,000 cubic
                        metres in 1905 supplied to 15,427 subscribers.</p>

                    <p>BUSINESS IN EGYPTIANS.</p>
                    <p>Owing to our weekly financial letter from our special correspondent in London
                        having 'been delayed in the post, and consequently not having been received
                        until this morning, we are unable to publish it in extenso. We append,
                        however, our correspondent's re marks on Egyptian shares, written under date
                        of the 19th inst. :-</p>
                    <p>Egyptians have followed the course of general stocks and shares this week,
                        and business has been on a small scale. There has been a slight easing off
                        in prices, but this is due to lack of support consequent on the holidays,
                        etc., rather than to any specific adverse influences. An exception to the
                        rule has been Delta Light Railway Preference, which have kept very firm. The
                        price for these is now.99 . Delta Land and Investment are 1#-x.d. and
                        Khedivial Mail are down to 15/16-1. National Bank of Egypt, after remaining
                        fairly steady at 197, have fallen to 18 3/4-19, and Agricultural Bank 7
                        11/16-13/16, after being 7 9/16-11/16. Daira Sanieh have been dealt in at
                        131, and the Deferred are quoted 68-72 without any business to report.
                        Egyptian Markets are firm at 28/, but Salt and Soda are only 16/6, at which
                        price they changed hands yesterday. There have been few dealings in Egyptian
                        Estates, the market price being 4-1. Land Bank of Egypt ore quoted 63-7, and
                        New Egyptian 6-1. Union Fonciere have been hardly mentioned and close 41-5.
                        There is nothing doing in Egyptian mining shares. Nile Valley leave off at
                        1/6 and Egyptian Mines Exploration at 1/-</p>
                    <p>Our correspondent also writes :</p>
                    <p>Anxiety is being expressed in some quarters as to what may be the result in
                        the early autumn of the unquestioned demand for gold which will be required
                        for the moving of the cotton crop in Egypt. Whilst it is certain that
                        extensive shipments will have to be made for this purpose, there is no need
                        for anxiety, inasmuch as the demand has been foreseen for some time past,
                        and the banking community will without doubt be well able to meet all the
                        calls that may be made upon it. These exports to Egypt may, of course, have
                        the effect of raising the value of money, and may even lead to an increase
                        in the Bank rate, but it is absurd to suppose that because Egypt has another
                        bumper cotton crop, which must in the ordinary course of business be paid
                        for, the whole business of the world will be upset by the gold requirements
                        consequent on such prosperity. Moreover, the Bank is steadily strengthening,
                        its position, and the reserve is now well within reach of the total at this
                        period last year, as we are likely to be spared the heavy demands from
                        America which were such a serious drain on our resources last summer, there
                        is good reason to anticipate that there will be a very substantial reserve
                        at the Bank before the Autumn exports begin.</p>

                    <p>The American Presbyterian Mission is spending £20,000 on its new buildings at
                        Assiout. | The site is at the head of the Ibrahimieh Canal near the Barrage,
                        and embraces 25 acres. The foundation stone was laid last February under the
                        auspices of the Synod of the Nile of the Evangelical Church of Egypt, and
                        the building is now about &amp; metre above ground. The erection is being
                        made under the superintendence of Mr. F. S. Hoyman, a well-known American
                        engineer from Pittsburg. The buildings in course of erection will be the
                        central college, containing 35 rooms for administration, lectures,
                        recitations etc., the Sawyer Memorial Science Hall, for the natural
                        sciences, a large dormitory for 75 students, a residence for the
                        professional staff and a ball for the Young Men's Christian Association. The
                        plans for the latter buildings are now being prepared in Pittsburg. The
                        grounds are being levelled and filled by Mr. C. S. Day, the Upper Egypt
                        contractor. The general style of architecture will be of a simple and
                        classic model.</p>
                    <p>The students at Assiout numbered 625 last term in the three departments,
                        which give the pupils a thorough education in science, mathematics,
                        literature, history, philosophy, eto. An interesting fact is that the
                        Mission has found it necessary to abandon the teaching of French as the
                        pupils have ceased to demand any instruction in that language. It is taught,
                        if requested, but out of the 625 pupils at Assiont not more than half a
                        dozen are learning French.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Alexander, the President of the College, is now spending the summer

                            calculated to inspire in him the higher principles of justice and
                            humanity. He was secretary to the Ottoman Delegation at the first Hague
                            Conference, "the parliament of the world.” But in simple justice to the
                            new Mutessarif we must not expect of him more than it is reasonably
                            possible for him to give. The fact of his being an Ottoman sobject and
                            an Ottoman functionary I places limits to his field of action, as any
                            attempt on his part at a liberal progressive policy or at radical
                            reform, is likely to be construed by his sovereign into disloyalty and
                            treason. The late Governor, by merely indulging at the outset of his
                            role in such dreams, incurred the imperial displeasure, although it was
                            realized later that these dreams were mere soap bubbles lacking the
                            backbone of serious purpose and earnest endeavour. Still the mere pose
                            of reform was sufficient to alienate the sympathy and favour of Yildiz.
                            The position of the Governor of the Lebanon is indeed an invidious one
                            by the mere fact of the ambiguity of its independence. The powers in
                            conceding what 'may have appeared to them at the time &amp; were detail
                            of delicacy have apparently not dreamt of the far reaching and sinister
                            consequences of such a concession. It is one of the many instances of
                            half-measures that in the end. were ruefully deplored.</p>
                        <p> The Lebanon stands in need of several radical reforms which the Governor
                            dare not tackle, at the penalty of imperial disgrace. The constitution
                            that had been elaborated for it, and given the important name of the
                            "organic law," is at best a hastily and indifferently gotten up draft
                            which may have been good enough for the primitive and insignificant
                            province that the Lebanon then was, but which has grown quite antiquated
                            and inadequate for present needs and conditions, hugely modified by such
                            civilizing factors as emigration and contact with the outer world, and
                            widespread education of a fairly high standard: The constitution of the
                            Lebanon has thus come to be a ridiculous instance of anachronism. The
                            subject is an important one, and requires to be dealt with at length and
                            in detail, by an able student of political economy and law, and brought
                            through an important organ of public thought, to the notice of the
                            Powers. In a limited article of this kind a mere rough outline of the
                            needed reforms may be attempted. By certain technical defects and the
                            absence of proper safeguards in the framing of the constitution a legion
                            of abuses have crept into the administration and drastic remedies have
                            now to be applied for their removal beyond the risk or possibility of
                            return. These minor abuses may be dealt with and incorporated in the
                            general programme of reform involving the overhauling of the antiquated
                            constitution. The sweeping work of radical reform must start with the
                            proper reservey of the Lebanon and its proper delimitation, and the
                            levying of the land tax accordingly. But fiscal reform need not stop
                            within the limits of the constitution, which is far from being above
                            fresh additions and emendations. A new tax on built property should be
                            introduced now that the Lebanon, as a favourite summer resort, counts
                            thousands of fine houses and hotels, which, absurd as it may seem,
                            contribute next to nothing to the Lebanese treasury. The poll-tax has
                            also to be levied according to a new census; and from these two items
                            alone it is estimated that the revenue will more than double, and with
                            this increase the budget may be so readjusted as to allow of the
                            proportionate increase of expenditure, which is so sorely needed to
                            provide adequate salaries to the civil functionaries and the militia. It
                            is ridiculous to think that a mudir or sub-governor receives only £4 to
                            £6 per mensem, and a judge about that sum, while a soldier receives only
                            4 piastres a day or a little more than sixpence. How can one expect such
                            badly paid public servants to be scrupulously honest, now especially
                            that living in the Lebanon has come to almost as dear as in Egypt. Then
                            reforms will have to be introduced into the elective system of the
                            Medjliss i e. the Administrative Council, a consultative body which,
                            barring the executive, has practically the whole management of the
                            internal affairs of the Lebanon relating to revenue and expenditure,
                            public works etc. The members of this Medjliss are elected in a certain
                            prescribed rotation, endowing them with a long term of office of six
                            years, - by the mayors or sheikhs of the villages, who in turn are
                            elected by the people. On the face of it, therefore, the election of the
                            members of the Medjiss would appear to be an expression of the will of
                            the people, but this is an illusion and sophism. The mayors being
                            practically under the thumb of the members of the Medjliss, vote in
                            accordance with the latter's dictation, so that the Administrative
                            Council is practically self-elective.</p>
                        <p>It is not enough that the Lebanese have 3 been deprived of the vital
                            benefits of a seaport enjoying steamship communication ; it is not
                            enough that they have been locked up in a barren chain of mountains and
                            deprived of at least, a bit of plain, and consequently o 5 every
                            appreciable agricultural resource, but 11 they have been endowed with an
                            inelastic
                        <cb n="5"/>                    
                            and antiquated constitution with inherent defects. With the general current
                            of progress and by means of various factors, it has been the privilege of
                            the Lebanon to be gratuitously blessed with, the economic and moral
                            conditions of the population have developed beyond any sanguine
                            anticipation, especially if we compare this with other provinces in the East
                            and the execution of the reforms roughly outlined above compels therefore
                            the attention of the Powers. Meantime the Governor General can by
                            intelligent vigilance and an incorruptible integrity help in making the best
                            of a bad case. He can help in preventing the faolty machinery of
                            administration from being further clogged by the dust of neglect, and
                            obstructed by all manner of abuses. By maintaining a strictly honest and
                            fair attitude he deals &amp; deadly blow to functionalism which is the bane
                            of the Lebanon, and by keeping a watchful eye on bribery he disarms that
                            whole band of intriguers whose sole occupation is to traffic with offices,
                            purchasing and then exploiting the Rame mercilessly at the expense of the
                            people. Moreover by disarming intrigue and blocking the path of bribery he
                            wins that peace of mind which is a priceless boon, and places himself beyond
                            that unwarrantable consularinterference which is so unworthily exploited by
                            the said band of intriguers, and which is calculated to affect so much the
                            dignity and rational independence of the Governor General. I can only speak
                            in general terms and innuendoes. The Mutessarif of the Lebanon has a
                            generous salary, sufficient, indeed, to enable him to lay aside a good fund
                            of independence after even one term of office. We wish the new Governor
                            General more than one “mandat", and we moreover wish he will withdraw with
                            not only &amp; material fortune but the better fortune of a good record and
                            a good name.</p>

                        <p>We have this morning received a letter from Mr. Manrice E. Bandmann informing
                            us that he has just arrived in Egypt to make arrangements for a visit of
                            "The Follies." This is a first class combination of London stars and we are
                            sure will be well appreciated by Mr. Bandmann's many Egyptian patrons. “The
                            Follies" will arrive early next month and stay in Egypt for two weeks, viz
                            one week in Cairo and a few nights at Alexandria. Several members of this
                            excellent little combination have had the honour of appearing before his

                        <p>During his stay in Cairo, Mr. Bandmann hopes to conclude arrangements for
                            some of his other companies to visit Egypt this coming season. The Bandmann
                            Opera Company is at present meeting with great success in the Philippine
                            Islands, and the Bandmann Comedy Company is playing at one of his Calcutta

                        <p>Mr. Bandmann's companies met with such great success on their last two
                            visits to Egypt and were so enthusiastically received, especially by
                            Cairene theatre goers, that we are sure the visit of "The Follies" will
                            be welcomed.</p>

                    <head>FRANCE AND EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The Paris correspondent of the Daily Telegraph," writing on yesterday week,
                        says</p>
                    <p>"The article which appeared iŋ the "Temps last evening, entitled "The Lambert
                        affair Sir Edward Grey,” has attracted a great deal of notice. The point
                        which the writer of this foreign bulletin wished to make particularly clear
                        was that in her agreement with Great Britain, concluded in 1904, France had
                        simply pledged herself to abandon all anti-English political action in
                        Egypt. France had, he argued, a great stake in a country in which three
                        milliards of her capital were invested, and with which she had had a long
                        connection, and she was not disposed to surrender &amp; single one of her
                        rights The writer considered that wherever a Frenchman had held an official
                        post, he ought to be succeeded by a compatriot 'and he laid particolar
                        stress on the maintenance of the French schools, contending that they were
                        &amp; moral force."</p>

                    <head>AMERICAN EXPEDITION.</head>
                    <p>The New York Metropolitan museum's bulletin contains a report of the progress
                        made in the excavations of the museum expedition at the Pyramids of Lisht.
                        This is what is said of the discoveries in connection with the pyramid
                        temple of Amenemhat I: -</p>
                    <p>The excavation of the temple site has yielded a very considerable amount of
                        material from the original temple of Amenemhat, from which the main features
                        of the structure can be determined. This includes many fragments and a
                        number of complete blocks of painted relief from inscriptions and scenes on
                        the palace wall. All the relief is most delicately and beautifully modelled,
                        and in many cases has its colour still freshly preserved. Blocks bearing in
                        baptions give the names of Amenemhat, a one case, those of Amenemhat and his
                        son Usertessen I. jointly, from which it is certain the temple was
                        constructed in par during the last ten years of Amenemhat I's reign, when,
                        as we know, Usertesen acted as co-regent with him, or that it was finished
                        after Amenemhat's death by Usertasen, who then placed his own name on the
                        temple walls with that of his father.</p>
                    <p>While this excavation of the pyramid temple has been in progress work has
                        boon carried on simultaneously for the last three months on the cemetery
                        west of the pyramid. As was to be supposed from the proximity of the
                        cemetery to the Royal tent of Amenembat its tombs are proving to be of
                        important twelfth dynasty types, both in their construction and in the
                        character of their do tente, "and their exos vation has been an important
                        factor in the satisfactory results of the year. </p>
                    <p>The expedition will continue this great work next season,</p>
