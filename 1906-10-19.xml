                        PORTENTOUS FIGURES.
                        INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE.
                        The House of Commons showed daring its last session that it intended to at last pay some attention to the conduet of affairs in Egypt and the Sodan, and one of the most vital matters about which questions were asked was the import of spirituous liquors into the Sudad. There appear to be a tondonoy to resent any animadversion made on Beyptian matters in the House of Commons, as though the management of this country shjuld be immune from oriticism, but all well wishers of the country sbonld welcome any le intelligent interest that is manifested.
                        There was a series of questions asked re 1 cently in the House of Commons on the subject alluded to above, which were of the utmost importance to the fature welfare oft the Sudan. In Lord Cromer's Sadan Report for 1901 be stated that he had drawn the attention of Sir Reginald Wingate to the large amount of spirits imported during 1900 into the Sudan. It then amounted to LE. 8,400 (250 tons). Last year the importa under the head of "Liquors" showed an enormous increase in five years, and were valued at LÉ 81,000. The matter will be taken up 1 seriously, it is to be borel, at the International Conference, at which fourteon Powers having colonies or interests in Africa are represented, now mosting at Brussels, to deliberate upon and devise means of controlliog the sale of alebolic liquors in Afrion, and this in view of the fatal or serious results arising from their immoderate use by the native population. The last conference was held in 1899. Questions in Parliamont.
                        The attitade of the Foreign Offise in this most vital question for the Sadan is not very illuminating and it is sincerely to be hoped that the House of Commons will keep an eye 1 on the matter.
                        Wo append the text of three questions, I which were asked in the House during last Jane. On the 12th of that month, Sir H. Cotton (Nottingham) asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs "whether he will farnish or procuro information showing in detail and me far as possible the places of origin and the quantities and values of spirituous liquors imported into the Sadan via Wady Halfa daring the several years 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904 and 1905, supplementing the statements made in Lord Cromer's annual Reports on Egypt and the Sadan to the effect that 950 tons (valued at £8,400) were imported in 1900, 241 tons in It 1901, 326 tons in 1902, 561 tons (valued at £119,738), in 1904, and a quantity not stated but valued at £84,000 in 1905, and whether he is in a position to explain the increase in the quantity of spirits so imported.
                        The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir Bdward Gray), replied: We have no intormation on the subject other than that contained in Lord Cromer's reports, but Lord Cromer will be asked if he can give the farther infor mation asked for.
                        Sir H. Cotton: I beg to ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Aftairs whether any, and, if 80, what steps have been taken with reference to Lord Cromer's statements in bis annual reports on the finance, administration, and condition of Egypt and the Sadan, to the effect that in 1900 he had drawn Sir Reginald Wingate's attention to the large amount of spirits which seemed to have been imported into the Sadan (od. 1012), page 63, and that in 1904 Sir Reginald Wingate's attention bad been drawn to the enormous increase in the quantities of spirits fioding their way to Uganda via the White Nile, and that the sale of liquors in the Sadan should be carefally watebed, and if necessary controlled, (od. 2409) page 122, | Sir Blward Grey: From Lord Cromer's an nual reports it is evident that this matter is receiving his careful attention. Inquiry will be made as to the precise answer to the bon. member's question. The Brussels Act.
                        Dr. Ratherford (Middlesex, Brentford) : I beg to ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he will state what action has been taken, in accordance with article 12 of the Anglo-Bgyptian Agreement of 1899, in which the contracting parties undertak, to psy special attention to the enforcement of the Brussels Act of 189) prohibiting the importation or manufacture of spirituous liquors in the region of the zone wbere, on account of religions, or from other motives, the use of distilled ligaors does not exist, or has not been developed
                        Sir Edward Grey : The Government of the Sudan bave drawn up various regulations for controlling and licensing the import and sale of alcoholio liquors in their territory. These regulations have been modified and added to from time to time, and the matter is one which engages the constant attention of the Sudanese Government.
                        SUNDAY AT KHARTOUM.
                        "Enquirer" writes to the London "Tribune" :
                        The Sirdar bas recently called attention to the Building Fund for the English Caorch at Khartoum, and the occasion seems a favour able one for raising the question whether Sunday ehoold not be observed there as the day of rest instead of Friday. The latter day is believed to have been chosen out of consideratio, fir the Muhamedan people; but is it against the Mohamedan faith to work on Friday? If not, it serms a great pity to de. throne the Christian Sonday and make it an ordinary working day.

                        A KHARTOUM EPISODE.
                        An interesting work, entitled With Lord Kitchener against the Mabdi," will abortly be poblished by Berlin poblishing house. The writer, Major Adolf von Tiedemand, who aocompanied the Sodan expedition as ropre ner tative of the Berlin General Staff, gives the following impressions :
                        "Lord Kitobener's lack of consideration is well known, and for just that reason, although N'mired and respected, be is unpopular with other officers. On the day fixed for the colobration in Khartoum, the company bad been ordered to be in readiness by six a.m. Wo stood hoor After hour, but po Sirdar arrived.

                        "Another reasOD, perhape, for his unpopalar ity is that when off duty' ho keeps aloof from the familiar intercourse which so often existe among English officers of very different rank. He is body and soul a soldier, and his military instincta tell him that this cannot be right. I had an impression that it pleased him when I maintained that respect for superiors which we knew so well in Germany. Kitobenor often called me to him during the maroh and con veraed about military conditions in the Father land.
                        "I seldom saw Lord Kitebener riding at gallop during a battle, but when he did, oven over places covered with great stoner, he rode like an export horseman. He is held to be one of the best horaemen in an army where overy officer is more or less a good rider.
                        "Without in the least being guilty of bravado, the Sirdar seemed absolutely insensible to personal danger. The entrance of Omdarman was not much less than a mad| piece of bravery. His coolness had something humorous in it. For instance, opoe when the gans were roaring away, Kitchener stopped to light his cigarette, quito anooncerned-in fact, carefully noting which way the wiod blew.

They are now being effered to the publio generally at the rate of L.B. 809 tbe feddap. There is nothing atrocious in Mr. Blunt taking advantage of the boom and dieposing, for L.B. 40,000 or LR. 50,000, of lands which possibly oost him as many half piastres, but there is something very much bordering upon a real and up-to-dato "atrocity" in the laying oat of these desirable sites for wetry reajdonoon.
                        The main roads on the Blunt property aro five metres wide and the by-roads foer metres only. Oa the building sites immediately adj aing the Blont property the main roads are 16 metres wide and the by-roads sither 10 or 12 metres. How those viotimised into buying building sites on the Blunt property are to provide footpaths on each side of even the main rɔads and leave room for hand barrow to get in with their goods and obattale, good. pool only knows. And is it not time that the attention of the Poblio Hoalth Department and the Pablio Worka Department abould be called to the mattar? To pormit of a few handred houses being ran op in a new district with nothing but alley.ways a DONDS of oom. monioation appears to be inviting an epidemio at the first favourable opportunity, and this 80 that Mr. Blant or his agents may squeeze the poople of his adopted country ont of the attermost farthing to be got för bis precious desert lande.
                        A RADICAL ON LORD CROMER.
                        Mr. Harold Spender, writing on "Bogland, Bgypt and Tarkay," in the current "Contem. porary Review," holds that strong or exooptional measures should be directed not so much against the tollaheen as against the Tarkish agitators or Bgyptians in the pay of the Turke. Coming from the pen of so strong a Radicalm Mr. Sponder, his testimony to the wisdom, the ondaring påtiedon, and the justice of Lord Cromer's role is very remarkable. As Mr. Spender well pats it:
                        "We have achieved their (the Egyptian peasantry':) happine88 ; we must work patient. ly for their loyalty. We have no reason to be a bamed of our record. We have respected the Moslem religion, observed the Moslem Friday, taught the Koran in oor soboole, and given to Moslems a preference both on the bench and in the Civil Service. We must not be tarred aside from this straight course. Wo. must wean the Egyptians from the Turk, not wrench them. The world has enough cages for black men. A sollen and cowed population would be a heavy price to pay for our continued oooupation-- sad ending to a great and glorious page in our history. It would be a real triumph for the Sultan. For what we really bave to defend from him is not our power, which he cannot touch, bat oor British justice, sanity and mercy."
                        THB £ 3,900 ROBBERY.
                        The Coptio olerk apod whom føll the doty of registering the letter containing £ 3,900 from the Anglo-Egyptian Bank is now under arrest, and the inquiry is being continued.
                        It is well to note that in the very great majority of instances the banks are content with registering packages containing some of money to no matter what value. The reason for this is not far to seek. By registration only £? can be recovered and by insurance L.B.400. It is therefore no advantage to the banks to register or insure with the Post Office and they consequently insare to the foll amount with some insurance company.
                        By the regulations of the Post Office the public are bound to insure and declare "papers of value, such as paper money, doods of sale, deeds of loan, interest and dividend warrants, mortgage deads, etc.," and we would therefore Suppose that the Post Office cannot be held legally responsible, as their conditions were not folfilled.
                        INTERESTING APPEAL.
                        Among the ones that will be shortly beard by the Mixed Court of_Appeal is a double appeal brought by the Egyptian Government Railways and by the beirs of the late Me. Acbille Albrecht against the judgment of the Cairo Mixed Tribunal ordering the former to pay an indemnity of L.E. 10,000 to the latter.
                        The Administration maintains that the accident was due to the victim's fault, and demands a complete discharge from the obliga tions imposed upon it by the Cairo Mixed Court of 1 st Instance. On the other band, tho beirs declare the indemnity allotted them in the first instance to be insufficient and demand its indrease.
                        Me. Scbiarabati Bey will represent the Administration and Me. Labsobnwill plead for the boirs.

                        The Directors of the Corporation of Wootoro Egypt, Limited, decided on the 9th instant to make the final call of 5/- per sbare, and we three months' notice had to be given such call becomes payable on the 9th January next. This action is of special intereet to the pomer ou Egyptian bolders of shares in the Corpo ration, since their share will appreciato in value, seeing that in all respecta tboy will then rank pari passu with the sbares quoted on the London Stock Brobange.
                        In issuing the notice of call the following communication is addressed to the abare. holders by the Seoretary: "lo sonding you the accompanying Call Notice, I am directed to point out that the Board dooided upon making this Call so as to ensure the uninterrupt od continuanoe of the construction of the Wostern Osses Railway, in order that the accumulating Oases freight may be handled at an early dato. At pronont platelaying is proceeding between kilometros 67 and 91, to which latter point the line is complotoly gradod in readiness for laying Orders for the delivery of the balance of permanent way matorial bave been given, together with instroc. tions for the sending forward of large sapplies DOW ready for abipment. Bvery effort will be made to complete the line m early as possible in the ensuing year."
                        We understand that the results obtained on the óxperimental plots on the new lands brought into cultivation around the wells sonk by the drilling staff have been 80 very succesful that the London Board are desirous of being pat in a position to largely supplement the steam drillers at present at work in the ONGs and to undertako land development on a very extensive solo. Consequently as soon as the large supplies of permanent way material can be transportod we shall see the rate of progress of the construction of its line, the Western Oases Railway, greatly accelerato. Samples of the coreals and other orops, idolading ootton, ("Yanovitz” variety of which, the produce of land never coltivated before, is of oxceptional excellence)grown on the now lands in tho Khargeh Oasis are op view, both in the Cairo and the London offices of the Corporation. Some of the rogolto have been so exceptional as to ozoito much stir looally, the excellence of the crops being very marked. This is of extremo importance in view of the ex'ensivo character of the grants of land-600,000 feddane - to which the Corporation is entitled.
                        The sluminous and other doposits of earthy minerals are being steadily worked in antici pation of the opening of the lino, and alam lenching is prooooding. Daring Aagost 140 tons of magnesium sulphato, of which a large doposit was recently loosted, was removed, the romoval doring the first twenty-four days of last month amounting to 144 tons.
                        A large consign ment of the best Saidi dates is being prepared for the London market and will shortly be shipped, and altogether the indications are Du norous that the intelligent oonduct of the bosiness of this Corporation will eventaslly, and before any long period bas elapsed, give a more than satisfactory retarn to
