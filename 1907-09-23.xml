                    <head>AN ANCIENT RELIGION.</head>
                    <p>To the excellent little series, "Religions :<lb/> Ancient and Modern," which
                        Messrs. Archi-<lb/>bald Constable are publishing, a new volume<lb/> is now
                        added,dealing with the ancient religion<lb/> of Japan, and coming from the
                        pen of the<lb/> author of "A history of Japanese Literature,"<lb/> Mr. W.G.
                        Ashton. The volume is very small<lb/> and Shintoism briefly described, while
                        the prac-<lb/> tical value of the work is considerably increased<lb/> by the
                        addition of a short bibliography of books<lb/> dealing witht this
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>Shitoism, in recent years, has llost som-<lb/> thing of its hold upon the
                        Japanese, and Budd-<lb/> hism now attracts a large number of devotees,<lb/>
                        while Christianity has an important following. The period when Shintoism
                        flourished in an<lb/> unadulterated form is exceedingly remote, and<lb/>
                        dates probably to the twelth century, if indeed,<lb/> that epoch had not
                        already begun to register a<lb/> significant departure from the original
                        standards<lb/> of the religion. Nevertheless, although Shinto-<lb/>ism
                        contains evidences of a Korean element<lb/> as well as certain Chinese
                        tracts, on the whole<lb/> it is an independent development of Japanese<lb/>
                        thought. At the same time it is not be con-<lb/> founded with ancestor
                        worship, with which<lb/> many Japanese and most European authorities<lb/> do
                        identify it. Although in its modern observ-<lb/> ance ther is, perhaps, too
                        much of the ancestor<lb/> worship element, Shintoism bespeaks the
                        adora-<lb/> tion of a god, not the mere worship of man. Much myth and a
                        confusion of the godheads<lb/> has crept into the Shinto Pantheon, the
                        latter<lb/> embracing many degrees of nature gods. In<lb/> the older
                        Shintoism th evarious types occupied a prominent position, but one among
                        them, the<lb/> Phallic symbolism, has long disappeared.</p>
                    <p>In the earliest stage of the religion, Shinto-<lb/> ism possessed its
                        Government Busea, and the<lb/> Mikado eas at once the high priest as well
                        as<lb/> the leader of the nation. Even nowadays the japanese Sovereign
                        occasionally officiates at<lb/> some of the Shinto rites, but more
                        frequently<lb/> he deputes his sacerdotal fucntions to some<lb/> on else.
                        Again, Shintoism can hardly be said<lb/> to possess a code of morals, but if
                        ethics are<lb/> conspicuous by their abscence the doctrine of<lb/>
                        cleanliness holds a prominent position. Fre-<lb/> quent bathing and the
                        constant change of<lb/> raiment were imposed upon its believers, while
                        certain acts of a sexual character were accom-<lb/> panied by religious
                        penalties, although adul<lb/>tery did not, and does not, constitute a
                        Shinto<lb/> offence. </p>
                    <p>At the present day most of the former ela-<lb/> borate ritual of Shinto is
                        neglected or shorn<lb/> of its ancient magnificence, the decline dating<lb/>
                        back to the appearance of Chinese philosophy, as well as Buddhism, in the
                        Island Kingdom.<lb/> Under the inlfuence of Buddhism a more<lb/> humane note
                        crept into Shintoism, while the<lb/> patronage of Buddhism by certain
                        Mikados<lb/> caused the earlier faith to lose some of its<lb/> standing, as
                        well as its holding upon the<lb/> people. To-day there is no doubt that
                        Shinto-<lb/>ism has fallen from its heigh estate. Without a code of morals,
                        or an efficient ecclesiastical<lb/> organization, wiht little aid from the
                        arts of<lb/> painting, sculpture, and even architecture, and with but a
                        scanty literature, it is doomed to<lb/> ultimate extinction among a people
                        familiar<lb/> with the religious and moral ideas of India,<lb/> china, and
                        Europe.</p>

                    <p>Mr. F. H. Trevethick, general manager of<lb/> the Egyptian State Railwtys has
                        adopted a<lb/> new method of heating the feed water for loco-<lb/> motives
                        working between Cairo and Alexandria<lb/> which is described in a recent
                        issue of the<lb/> "Revue Industrielle." The water is heated by<lb/> the
                        exhaust steam in combination with the<lb/> waste heat of the smoke box
                        gases. The feed-<lb/> water is forced into the boiler by a horizontal<lb/>
                        motor pump placed on the left-hand side of<lb/> the fire-box, and using
                        steam at full boiler<lb/> pressure. The water passes from the pump<lb/>
                        through the first heater, which is formed of a<lb/> cylinder set vertically
                        between the frames be-<lb/> low the feed pump. It is 36 ins. high and
                        con-<lb/> tains ninety steel tubes 7-16 ins. in diameter,<lb/> about which
                        the exhaust steam is made to<lb/> circulate. The steam condensed by the
                        cold<lb/> feed-water is collected in the bottom of the<lb/> cylinder and is
                        removed by a pipe and cock.<lb/> The feed-water is taken from this first
                        heat<lb/> er and sent on through a pipe 2 1/2 ins, in<lb/> diameter to
                        second and third heaters, which<lb/> are set horizontally outside the
                        cylinders in<lb/> such a way as to receive a part of the exhaust<lb/> steam
                        on its way to the stack. The condensing<lb/> surface, which is the same in
                        the three, is<lb/> formed of forty-two tubes 7-16 ins. in diameter<lb/> and
                        5-ft. 6 ins. long, set in a cylindrical box.<lb/> The second heater, which
                        on the right-hand<lb/> side, is divided by a partition in such a way<lb/>
                        that the water traverses it twice in going<lb/> through; in the third heater
                        there is no such<lb/> partition. The water passes from the third<lb/> heater
                        into a fourth heater, formed of an an-<lb/> nular chamber placed in the
                        smoke-box, and<lb/> containing 265 water tubes of 1 in. inside<lb/> diameter
                        and 18 ins. long, arranged in three<lb/> concentric rings, which finally
                        deliver to the<lb/> boiler on its centre line directly back of the<lb/>
                        smoke-box.</p>

                            correspondent says :- Most<lb/> leading papers reproduced yesterday a
                            letter<lb/> published in the "Figaro," addressed nominally<lb/> to Sir
                            Henry Campbell-Bannerman by Mustafa<lb/> Kamel, but in reality intended
                            probably as an<lb/> irritant trial of French opinion. If this is
                            the<lb/> case, Kamel has signally failed, as hardly &amp;<lb/> single
                            comment was made yesterday, and the<lb/> "Figaro" itself, which gave the
                            hospitality of<lb/> its columns to the original publication, today<lb/>
                            finally disposes of any hopes which Egyptian<lb/> agitators may haye
                            entertained of finding<lb/> support in France. Upto 1904 the
                            Egyptian<lb/> Nationalists certainly based their expectations<lb/> on.
                            French assistance, but the "Figato" says<lb/> that since the agreement
                            with England they<lb/> ought to, know that when France has, given<lb/>
                            her word she keeps it. So far as British occu-<lb/> pation goes or
                            British policy in Egypt, France<lb/> is dumb. But there is a point on
                            which the<lb/> "Figaro" feels at liberty to say a few words, and<lb/> it
                            says them as follows:-</p>
                        <p>"Very sincerely do we, believe that the Eng-<lb/> lish make one mistake
                            in attributing the<lb/> aspirations of the Nationalists to foreign
                            inspi-<lb/> ration, and we think that it would be to the<lb/> interests
                            of Britain to give more weight to<lb/> convictions which may hamper her
                            momen-<lb/> tarily, but whose genuineness seems to us<lb/> beyond doubt.
                            In the work accomplished. in<lb/> Egypt a distinction must be drawn
                            between<lb/> the substance and the form. The result attained<lb/> is,
                            beyond criticism, but the way of attaining it<lb/> has often been had.
                            The eminent organizer,<lb/> Cromer, was wanting in political tact, and
                            a<lb/> contempt for the people he governed interfered<lb/> with his
                            foresight. The Denshawi affair, was an<lb/> incontestable instance of
                            this.</p>
                        <p>"His colleagues, Sir Vincent Corbett, who<lb/> has since retired, and
                            Messrs. Dunlop and<lb/> Boyle, who are still in office, have always<lb/>
                            aggravated, by their characters, the painful<lb/> side, to the Egyptians
                            of the duties they had<lb/> to perform. And the French, too - witness
                            the<lb/> case of Lambert-have not always escaped<lb/> their vexations.
                            Here we have a method of a<lb/> system and persons that it would be a
                            mistake<lb/> to consider out of reach of attack. England<lb/> would be
                            better served by moderation and<lb/> kindness. Correct attitude and
                            abstention from<lb/> extremes on the Egyptian side, liberality and<lb/>
                            good grace on the British--these are what are<lb/> wanted."<lb/></p>
                        <p>The reception of Kamel's letter by the Paris<lb/> Press should act as a
                            decided cooler on the<lb/> ardour of Egyption agitators, particularly

                            appeals with French ink on<lb/> French paper, may giye up all hope of

                        <p>The Pasha recalls that the day, September<lb/> 14, is a day memorable in
                            the history of Egypt.<lb/> It is the centenary of the evacuation of
                            Egypt<lb/> by British troops and at the same time the<lb/> twenty-fifth
                            anniversary of their entry into<lb/> Cairo. The day has a double
                            interest in that<lb/> it reminds Egyptians of the glory of their<lb/>
                            fathers who defended their country and forced<lb/> England to renounce
                            the conquest of Egypt<lb/> during the space of a century, while at
                            the<lb/> same time it gives Egyptians cause to remem-<lb/> ber the
                            official declarations which accompanied<lb/> the present occupation and
                            the engagements<lb/> definitely entered into by England.</p>
                        <p>"Few Englishmen," adds the National leader,<lb/> "give thought to-day to
                            the promises made by<lb/> that Government of Queen Victoria, or to
                            the<lb/> many speeches made by her Ministers, who<lb/> declared that the
                            continued occupation of<lb/> of Egypt by England would be shameful
                            for<lb/> the Bristish Throne and the British Empire.<lb/> But we
                            Egyptians have not forgotten them,<lb/> and, in spite of those who
                            affirm that politics<lb/> are but lying and cheating, we cannot
                            believe<lb/> that a great nation will continue to soil its<lb/> history
                            by a nameless spoliation. If the lessons<lb/> of history are
                            insufficient to prove to British<lb/> Imperialists that Egypt can belong
                            only to the<lb/> Egyptians, the awakening of the Egyptian <lb/> naition
                            should show them that the future of<lb/> Egypt lies with liberty and
                            independence."</p>
                        <p>The Pasha declares that misfortunes only<lb/> serve to strengthen the
                            patriotism of the Egyp-<lb/> tians. Denshawi did more for the
                            development<lb/> of Nationalism than the greatest efforts of<lb/>
                            Egyptian patriots have ever done.</p>
                        <p>"The problem before you, sir," he adds, "and<lb/> before the British
                            nation, is whether England<lb/> desires to make a friend or an enemy of
                            Egypt.<lb/> If England considered evacuation possible in<lb/> 1890, and
                            had even fixed the date for it in the<lb/> Drommond-Wolff Convention,
                            how can she<lb/> maintain that it is impossible, to-day? What<lb/>
                            Liberal can serionsly contend that the hour<lb/> for the evacuation has
                            not yet struck, when<lb/> Gladstone recognised, in the letters which
                            he<lb/> wrote me in 1896, that the hour of evacuation<lb/> had struck
                            several years ago? You have your-<lb/> self declared in one of your
                            speeches that even<lb/> a good Government can never replace self-<lb/>
                            government, I say that where a people is consci-<lb/> ous of its rights
                            nothing will make it forget its<lb/> independence, and a foreign
                            Government, even<lb/> though it be a model of benignity (douceur)
                            is<lb/> always hated and execrated. A nation like<lb/> ours which
                            through the centuries has acoumt-<lb/> lated forces of patience and
                            energy does not<lb/> know despair, and will not be hindered by. any<lb/>
                            obstacle in the work of reconquering its inde-<lb/> pendence. It remains
                            for a Liberal England to<lb/> decide whether that independence shall

                        <p>This match was resumed on Saturday at<lb/> 2 p.m. H. B. Carver and
                            Prosser bowling to<lb/> Shuttleworth and Pte. Rice. Rice was out<lb/>
                            almost directly and Shuttleworth run out<lb/> through a misunderstanding
                            for a veru useful<lb/> 22. The last wicket gave some trouble and<lb/>
                            the innings closed for 159, thereby a-<lb/> head of Aexandria.</p>
                        <p>The Alexandria batting order was altered<lb/> in second innings the
                            brothers Carver<lb/> going in first against the bowling of Graves.<lb/>
                            and Wright. Had Cairo taken all their catches<lb/> the home team might
                            have been dismissed<lb/> for a vry small score, for H. B. Carver
                            who<lb/> played the highest innings of the match was<lb/> dropped twice
                            early in his innings. H. P.<lb/> Carver was soon bowled in trying to
                            hit<lb/> Graves, and Prosser fell to a fine catch at<lb/> point. W. E.
                            Peel followed and by hard<lb/> hitting knocked up 26 which included 5
                            fours,<lb/> during his innings. Marsden, Mainprice and<lb/> and McLean
                            leaving. Seven wickets were<lb/> down for 140. Barnard was bowled for
                            173<lb/> and the innings declared for 8 wickets, Hay<lb/> being not out
                            36.</p>

                        <p>The declaration left Cairo with 144 runs to make in an hour and 35
                            minutes. Though Preston was out in the first over Wright and
                            Shuttleworth played good forcing cricket till the former fell to a good
                            catch in the long field for a most useful 27 Sergt. Smith helped
                            Shuttleworth to add a few, and Sherringham then came in and played good
                            cricket, being very severe on the home change bowlers who were very
                            inaccurate in the length. With 110 up he fell at last to a shortish ball
                            from Prosser who had resumed bowling and with Shuttleworth, who also
                            played extremely well out to a good catoh by Hay, Alexandra seemed to
                            have a chance of at least staying off defeat. With Major Hos- kins
                            bowled at 124 a victory for the homesters seemed just possible, but
                            Private Rice coming in was not in the least affected by the situation
                            and hit the first, ball he received off his middle stump to long leg for
                            4. Three more boundar- ies and several singles bronght the score up to a
                            tie and at this point Boyes, who showed equal sang froid, hit a two and
                            Cairo were winners by four wickets 3 minutes from time. The Cairo eleven
                            was well captained and though at times uncertain in the field contained
                            some excellent workers. The home team was good in the field but very
                            weak in bowling.</p>

                        <p>(From Our Own Correspondent)</p>

                        <p>Could heroic enterprise go further ? In the<lb/> Gardens Theatre too! But
                            its fullfilment <lb/> amply earned the success. Really the per<lb/>
                            formance was most admirable and the house<lb/> which was packed--not a
                            stall or a box to be<lb/> had when the curtain rose--showed its
                            appre-<lb/> ciation repeatedly and heartily. M. Silvestre<lb/> was a
                            worthy Cyrano, his voice, rich, vibrant,<lb/> full of colour, ranging
                            from tenderness to rage,<lb/> from the sardonic to the self pleased, his
                            vary-<lb/> ing facial expression, his swift and graceful<lb/> gesture
                            all heightened his admirable inter<lb/> pretation. Perhaps at moments he
                            insisted<lb/> overmuch on the, Coquelin roar and drawl :<lb/> but the
                            balcony scene, the Cadets de Gascogne,<lb/> and above all the journey to
                            the moon were<lb/> splendid. Mile Theulee we know for an ex-<lb/>
                            cellent and versatile actress: her only fault<lb/> seemed to be a
                            tendency to self-possession<lb/> hardly in accordance with the vaporous.
                            nature<lb/> of a 'precieuse,' but in the camp scene she<lb/> excelled.
                            De Guiche (M. Berthoud) Was most<lb/> dignified in his rage, irony, or
                            vengeance<lb/> Rageneau (M. Henris) was an admirable pastry<lb/>
                            cook-poet: Christian (M. Goidsen) was quite,<lb/> good. The whole troupe
                            played with a vigour<lb/> and enthusiasm that carried through the <lb/>
                            minor parts and indeed the whole play with a <lb/> swing. The Gascons
                            were one and all worthy<lb/> of their regiment: and one could well
                            over<lb/> look the small. deficiencies in staging and <lb/> costume and
                            inevitable in so small a theatre.<lb/> A friend remarked to me by the
                            way on <lb/> the apparent exaggeration of the acting, <lb/> but surely
                            M. Rostand's play is more or<lb/> less a delightful gascounade
                            throughout : what<lb/> else could it be? It's, hero, a poet, poor,
                            unpro-<lb/> tected save by his own fierce and reckless sword<lb/> the
                            best gaurdian of his reputation, his verses<lb/> and his nose--its
                            heroine a blue stocking who <lb/> drives through the enemy's lines right
                            to the <lb/> post of danger,--its least characters roystering<lb/>
                            swaggering blades who hesitated to prefer <lb/> fighting to eating
                            alone--drunk on powder as<lb/> when the bravo and the soldier reigned
                            supreme<lb/> in the word of men, and the ultra Roman-<lb/> ticiste in
                            the world of women. And we had all<lb/> this in the dead sense continue,
                            and its success be as <lb/> sure sample as it was last night.</p>

                        <p>Professor A. H. Sayce writes to the "Times"<lb/> as follows:--</p>

                        <p>I have just recieved a letter from Mr.<lb/> Theodore M. Davis, the
                            fortunate discoverer of<lb/> the tomb of Queen Teie at Thebes, relative
                            of the communication of your "Occasional Cor<lb/>respondent," in which
                            the writer announces <lb/> that Dr. Elliott Smith's examination of
                            the<lb/> bones from the tomb proves them to have been<lb/> those, not of
                            the Queen, but of a young man. <lb/> Your Correspondent, however has
                            gone wrong<lb/> in one important particular; the inscription<lb/> on the
                            mummy-case does not state theat it<lb/> belonged to the King
                            Akh-en-Aten, but that<lb/> it had been given by the King to
                            his<lb/>mother Teie. If Dr. Elliot Smith's con-<lb/>clusions are
                            corroberated, all his dis<lb/> covery woyld prove would be that the
                            mum-<lb/>my of the Queen had been torn to pieces like<lb/> that of the
                            King; and that, subsequently when<lb/> an attempt was made to put the
                            tomb in order,<lb/>the first mummy that came to hand was thrust<lb/>
                            into the Queen's jewelry wrappings, and coffin.<lb/>It was not the first
                            time that the Egyptian<lb/> resorted to similar measures, and it
                            would<lb/> explain the otherwise puzzling absence of funer<lb/>al
                            furniture in the tomb.</p>
                        <p>But Mr. Davis brings forward evidence<lb/> which seems to throw doubt on
                            the results of<lb/> Dr. Elliotts Smith's examination. He tells me<lb/>
                            that immediatley after the opening of the tomb<lb/> he had the mummy
                            examined by Dr. Pollock<lb/> of Luxor, "and a prominent American
                            Obste-<lb/>trician." In the presence of the doctor and <lb/> surgeon,
                            Mr. Ayrton, and one or two other<lb/> persons, the mummy was opened and
                            the bones<lb/> exposed. In fact, the mummy had absorbed so<lb/> much
                            moisture that it could not be unwrap-<lb/> ped, but it yielded to the
                            touch and disin-<lb/>tegrated to such an extent that there was no
                            difficulty in exposing the bones from<lb/> end to end. The pelvis was
                            admitted to be the<lb/> criterion of the sex. Both doctor and surgeon
                            <lb/> insantly agreed that it was the pelvis of a<lb/> woman. The
                            surgeon made a most thorough<lb/> examination, and expained to us that
                            it was a<lb/> woman's pelvis, and what the difference is<lb/> between
                            the pelvis of a man and woman. He <lb/> practically stated that the
                            'greater breadth of<lb/> the pelvic arch gives one of the most
                            easily<lb/> appreciable points of contrast between the male<lb/> and
                            female pelvis; the pelvic arch in the female<lb/> forms an angle of from
                            90 deg. to 100 deg., while<lb/> in the male it averages from 70 deg. to
                            75deg." </p>

                        <p>The salvage steamer "Berger Wilhelm"<lb/> came into harbour on Saturday
                            night with a<lb/> heavy cargo of cases of whiskey and these were<lb/>
                            discharged and landed yesterday morning. The<lb/>"Olivemoor" is now free
                            of general cargo and<lb/> only coal remains in her holds to be
                            jettisoned.<lb/> A second salvage steamer is on her way out<lb/> to
                            assist the "Berger Wilhelm" and should<lb/> arrive diring the course of
                            the day. A bad sea<lb/> was running on Saturday night, there being
                            a<lb/> very heavy swell, but since then the conditions<lb/> have greatly
                            improved and are to-day most<lb/> favourable. The salvage steamer, which
                            return<lb/>ed to the "Olivemoor" this morning, is now<lb/> standing some
                            500 metres away.</p>
