                        ROOSEVELT'S SPEECH. Mr. Roosevelt's speech at Provincetown wa in every way
                        worthy of the occasion and of the man who made it says the "Spectator.” It
                        had however, in it nothing in the nature of surprise but was exactly what
                        one would have expected. The only surprising thing about it, indeed is the
                        fact that anyone could have imagined that the President should or would
                        adopt a tone different from that which he did adopt Consider the situation.
                        During the last ten years the national Legislature has passed a series of
                        Acts regulating and controlling the actions of the great trading
                        corporations and Trusts. Hitherto, partly owing to Excessive weakness and
                        apathy, but still more to the almost infinite capacity for delay displayed
                        by all branches of the Judicature in the United States, the law has not been
                        put into operation, or when it has been the ingenuity of the corporation
                        lawyers ha sufficed to evade it. At last, however, th Courts have got to
                        close quarters with Trust, and a Judge has actually declared the elementary
                        truth, as we regard it here, that i a company, no matter how powerful, break
                        the law, it must take the consequences in the matter of fines and other
                        punishments provided by the statute, just as if it were a pod individual or
                        a small trading company. Never thele-s, so strange has the notion that eve
                        the Trusts must obey the law grown to the people of the United States, and
                        so ingrained has become the belief that if only a trading corporation is big
                        enough and wealthy enough it stands above, at any rate outside, th law, that
                        a vast number of Americans appear to have expected that the President would
                        shrink back when he saw the results of the law he has called for or
                        approved, and that h would somehow or other prevent those law being applied.
                        He would, it was averred, "say the situation" and "restore confidence" b</p>
                    <p>preventing the “persecution" of industrial | enterprises. These who, in
                        effect, asked tha</p>
                    <p>the Trusts should be given a position | privilege have had their answer from
                        M Roosevelt's own lips. In terms that cannot be mistaken, the President has
                        told his fellow citizens that the law is no respecter of person and that
                        there cannot be one law for the rio company and another for the poor
                        individual That the enunciation of such commonplace should have caused
                        "distarbence," "sensation, "anxiety," and "gloom" in business circles is
                        measure of how far the spirit of lawlessness has affected the mind of
                        America. One might gather from some of the comments on M Roosevelt's speech
                        that he was a red-hot S cialist bent, torch in hand, on the ruin of bi
                        country.</p>
                    <p>If we turn to the text of Mr. Roosevelt speech, it will be seen that we have
                        in no wa exaggerated the spirit in which he deals with the problem with
                        which the United States faced :-"There is a growing determination in our
                        country that no man shall ainass a green fortune by special privilege,

                        that is anti-social." "Experience," continued Mr. Roosevelt, "has shown that
                        an effort to control great corporations by mere State action cannot produce
                        wholesome results I believe in a national incorporation law for corporations
                        engaged in inter State business. I believe. furthermore, that the need for
                        action is most pressing as regards the corporations which, because they are
                        common carriers, exercise a quasi-public function, and which can be
                        completely controlled in all respects by the Federal Government by the
                        exercise of the power conferred upon it under the interState commerce
                        clause, and, if necessary, under the post road clause of the Constitution."
                        After noting the allegation that the Government had caused the recent
                        disturbance in the stock markets, and ought to do something to ease the
                        situation, the President dealt directly with the question we have touched on
                        above, -- i.e., whether breakers of the law should be exempt if only rich
                        enough and engaged in sufficiently enormous enterprises :</p>
                    <p>"But it may well be that the determination of the Government, in which,

                        of having caused these men to combine to bring about as much financial
                        stress as they possibly can, in order to discredit the policy of the
                        Government, and thereby to secure the reversal of that policy so that they
                        may enjoy the fruits of their own evildoing. That they have misled many good
                        people into believing that there should be such a reversal of policy is
                        possible. If so, I am sorry, but it will not alter my attitude. Once and for
                        all let me say that, so far as I am concerned, and for the eighteen months
                        of my administration that remain, there will be no change in the policy we
                        have | steadfastly pursued. It is idle to ask me not</p>
                    <p>to prosecute criminals, rich or poor, but I desire no less emphatically to
                        have it understood that we have undertaken, and will undertake, no action of
                        a vindictive type, and, above all, no action which shall inflict great or
                        inherited suffering upon innocent stockholders and upon the public as a
                        whole. Our purpose is to act with the minimum of harshness compatible with
                        obtaining our ends. In the man of great wealth who has earned his wealth
                        honestly and used it wisely pre recognise a good citizen, worthy of all
                        praise and respect. Business can only be done, under modern conditions,
                        through corporations, and our purpose is heartily to favour corporations
                        that do well.``</p>
                    <p>There is no need to make Mr. Roosevelt's plain speaking planer. No one who is
                        not anxious, or, rather, determined, to mistake him can imagine that he is
                        any enemy to industry or, to the legitimate accumulation of wealth, or that
                        he has any Sovialistic bias. On the contrary, it is clear that he is to be
                        counted as the best friend of property and of a State organised on
                        individualistic lines. He stands for the rights of property and the rights
                        of the individual against a lawlessness which, if persisted in, can only
                        have one end,--the destruction of * State based on individual freedom and
                        private property.</p>
                    <p>If we look at the President's speech as a whole, we shall see that he is
                        striking against what is in reality the chief defect of modern America on
                        the political side. The story of the politician who was asked to give his
                        opinion on the Prohibition Law is one of those "luciferous sayings' ' of
                        which Bacon speaks. "I'm for the law, but again it's enforcement," said the
                        politician. The people of the United States have hitherto believed too much
                        in the virtue of the printed statue, and have thought too little of how to
                        carry out the law. Careless in their easy optimism, and persuaded by
                        claptrap rhetoricians that the principles of democracy would be infringed by
                        giving their Judges the pay, the prestige, and the social power and
                        influence which they possess in this country-a power and influence which
                        greatly facilitate even-handed justice when millionaires and politicians
                        with a "pull" are to be dealt with, and in no way prejudice the poor man's
                        cause they have too often allowed their Courts to be impotent when faced by
                        great and wealthy trading organisations. The American people have been too
                        apt to think, in fact, that when a thing is ordered to be done it is done.
                        They have forgotten that there is another stage quite as important as giving
                        an order, and that is seeing to its execution. Unless ample provision is
                        made for such execution, it is better not to give the order at all. Every
                        disregarded or imperfectly obeyed order is a serious danger and source of
                        weakness to those who give it. Men are taught to think that it is safe and
                        easy to disobey. If, then, Mr. Roosevelt can teach his fellow-countrymen
                        that they must give up the national habit of passing laws and then
                        forgetting to carry them out, he will have conferred on them an incalculable
                        benefit. The man who is for a law but against its enforcement is a national
                        disgrace and a national danger. Those who tolèrste and are amused by ench an
                        attitude can expect nothing but scandal heaped on scandal, and the gradual
                        degradation of every social and political institution.</p>

                    <p>DESERT</p>
                    <p>SURVEY DEPARTMENT REPORT.</p>
                    <p>This report contains a preliminary account of the topography and geology of
                        the Eastern Desert between lat. 22° N. and 25° N. It has been compiled from
                        the field notes of the surveyors and geologists in order to furnish as soon
                        as possible a general account of the district, without waiting for the final
                        results of petrological and other studies which will occupy a considerable
                        time. It may happen therefore that some of the results arrived at in this
                        preliminary report may be considerably modified by subsequent field-work and
                        laboratory study.</p>
                    <p>The topography was commenced in the winter of 1904 when a chain of
                        triangulation was carried from Edfu on the Nile to the shore of the Red Sea,
                        and though this work occupied most of his time, Mr. Villiers Stuart also
                        added a certain amount of topographic detail. In the following season two
                        parties, under Mr. Villiers Stuart and Dr. Ball respectively, extended this
                        line southwards approximately along the 34° 15 E. and 34° 45 E. meridians,
                        the former being carried southwards as far as lat. 22° N. and then joined to
                        the Nile Valley triangulation in lat 23° 10 N. while the latter (Eastern)
                        chain was carried down to lat. 24° N. In addition the members of the
                        Geological Survey carried out as much topographical and geological work as
                        was possible in the time available.</p>
                    <p>The increase of mining operations in this portion of the desert has
                        necessitated the accurate determination of a number of points by
                        triangulation from which concessions and leased areas could be located. This
                        work was carried out by means of 6-inch micrometer theodolites, and was
                        connected to the second order triangulation of Egypt at Edfu, Kom Ombo and
                        Dakka. Three control base-lines were measured which established that the
                        accuracy of the work was well maintained and of a much higher order than was
                        absolutely necessary for locating mining claims. It is, however, of very
                        considerable value in controlling the topography of the western coast of the
                        Red Sea, and the additional cost of the higher class work is extremely small
                        since transport and delays of travel account for by far the greater portion
                        of the expenditure in time and money,</p>
                    <p>A measure of th. accuracy of the work may be in the causing differences at
                        Kom Ombo and Dakka. At the former the differences of latitude and longitude
                        when computed through the Desert and Valley triangulation were 0'.15 and
                        1".9 respectively, while at Dakka the corresponding quantities were 15.3 and
                        0".5. This gives every confidence in the accuracy of the triangulation. As
                        the result of connecting the western shore of the Red Sea with the Nile
                        Valley through a chain of nine quadrilateral figures, an improved value has
                        been obtained for the longitude of this coast-line.</p>

                    <p>A SECOND INTERVIEW.</p>
                    <p>The Alexandrian correspondent of th "Moayad” has been granted a second
                        interview with Sir Vincent Corbett, in the course a which the retiring
                        financial adviser remarks concerning the meetings of the Council : Ministers
                        during the summer months that | did not find the papers right in what they
                        hay written on this sobject. By customary decree the Ministers replace each
                        other during the absence of others and, thus they have legal authority to do
                        so. It is known that business in summer is not as a rule of special impor

                        for their absence.</p>
                    <p>In reply to a question concerning nativ opinion on Mr. Dunlop's policy Sir
                        Vincen Corbett asked if the Egyptians really object to the educational
                        adviser, to which the interviewer replied that out of the eleven millions of
                        Egyptian people all longed for him to leave the country to assume a higher
                        position elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Sir Vincent Corbett then spoke upon obli gatory education and the impedimeuts
                        which hinder its propaganda, such as money, suitable buildings and the
                        engagement of professors In answer to a question as to whether Mr. Dunlop
                        was returning or not he smil ed and said "I do not know.” The correspondent
                        then questioned him upon hil opinion relating to self government and the
                        wider anthority demanded for the Legislative Council and the General
                        Assembly. The Financial Adviser replied that the time for these departures
                        had not yet come, and gave the same reasons as contained in Lord Cromer's
                        report, giving evidence that his political opinions are the same as those of
                        Lord Cromer He was then asked why the Government did not create a Municipal
                        Council in Cairo as in Alexandria and the provinces. In reply he said that
                        he was evidently in ignorance of the difficulties in Alexandria which
                        troubled the Government. He contended that as Cairo was much bigger than
                        Alexandria and was the residence of the Khedive and the Ministers, it would
                        therefore be very difficult to establish a Municipality with a mixed
                        council, and one that would be able to earry on affairs without those
                        differences and difficulties which necessitate the Government infinite
                        tronble. The inhabitants of Alexandria, he pointed out, are complaining of
                        the taxes levied on them, and altogether are opposed to the idea of a Cairo
                        Municipality.</p>
                    <p>The interviewer said that as the Government has opened credits for 64
                        millions, could it not open one for Cairo drainage, instead of resorting to
                        increased taxation, to which Sir Vincent Corbett replied that the drainage
                        project required two millions, and would be of great nse to the inhabitants,
                        who would only have to pay a small extra tax. He was then questioned upon
                        his relations with the Khedive and Ministers. He replied "I am still in the
                        Government service and receiving my salary, and must inform you that the
                        regulations of the Government do not permit officials entering into
                        discussions with press representatives."</p>
                    <p>He then changed the subject and in the course of his remarks said that it
                        behoves the Egyptians to pay special attention to the promotion of
                        agriculture, so earnestly encouraged by the Khediye.</p>
                    <p>CAIRO MOTOR-CAR FATALITY.</p>
                    <p>It has been announced in connection with the recent motor car accident which
                        resulted in the death of a prominent native notable that the family of the
                        defunct have strongly opposed the exhumation of the body as requested by the
                        Italian Consulate in order to establish the responsibility of the chauffeur,
                        and the latter has been liberated.</p>
                    <p>The matter is now closed and it is to be presumed that no further steps will
                        be taken. At the same time it is to be hoped that some sort of regulation
                        with regard to the question of responsibility of drivers and speed control
                        will be very soon established.</p>

                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "BGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,--In "The Man and his Programme" such I believe is the title, more
                        or less, of the "Egyptian Standard's” articles, Hafez Effendi Awad, whose
                        austere virtue bas recently received such flattering testimonials from the
                        Cairo Press, is handled with vigour and severity by the trumpeters of the
                        one and only nationalist leader,-avoid spurious imita. tions, and warned in
                        effect, that if he does not rapidly come to heel and recognise in Mustapha
                        Pasha Kamel the chief of the Nationalist movement, it will be the worse for
                        him. It will be interesting to see whether Hafez Effendi will accept this
                        hint or whether his self respect and independence are sufficiently
                        well-developed to encourage him to take up a line of his own.</p>
                    <p>Meantime the "Minbar," so says the "EgyptTian Standard's” leader writer, has
                        received a wire from its joint editor and co-proprietor announcing that the
                        Times'' has declared in favour of his programme, a statement which has
                        aroused the bitter indignation if Mr. Rudy (or is it Mr. Maloney 1) who
                        devotes three quarters of a column addressed originally to Mr. Hafez Awad to
                        a thunderous onslaught non "Times and Co.” the “Imperialists'' and other
                        monsters who are apparently accused - Heaven knows on what little evidence
                        of cherishing so fell a grudge against the blameless Mustapha, that to spite
                        him they are ready to support the ignoble and plagiaristic Hafez ! But, Sir,
                        I have searched the files of the "Times," and many other Imperialistic
                        organs, from August 25 till date bat mot a word of Hafez Awad, his programme
                        or his suggestions. Stay though -- in the "Times' ' of August 26 I see the
                        headline "Manifesto by Mulai Hafid;" can it be that Mr. Hafez. Awad has made
                        the natural slip of imagining that it refers to his programme, or have Mr.
                        Charles Rudy or Mr. W. T. Maloney, who spell Hafid with a "Z,” detected in
                        the headline an allusion to the Editor of "Al Minbar ?"</p>
                    <p>Otherwise how are the “Standard's" attacks on the Imperialist Press in
                        general and the</p>
                    <p>Times" in particular, annt Mr. Awad's programme, to be reconciled with the
                        fact that these papers have thus for said no word neither of Hafez Awad, or
                        of his proposals ?</p>
                    <p>GAEL.</p>
                    <p>(“From Al Watan") Once again that new self-styled leader of man Egyptian
                        party, Mr. Hafez Awad, has</p>
                    <p>carried the joke too far. He informs his newspaper by wire from Switzerland
                        that</p>
                    <p>Sir Edward Grey has sent him a letter by post paying him compliments and
                        acknowledging the receipt of-bis petition. "Al Minbar” publishes this
                        message with visible signs of triumphant pride, its editors well knowing
                        that the joke will have the required effect among the simple readers.
                        Mustafa Pasha Kamel arrived at his present position and acquired
                        considerable amounts of money from this class of readers by practising the
                        same joke and making the fellah believe that he was an important leader who
                        was received by kings and communicated with party leaders and ministers.
                        That Mr. Hafez should resort to the same expedient this year was in no way
                        wonderful, seeing that the road to fame and gain was 80 easy and that
                        Mustafa Kamel was allowed to monopolize it so long. Hafez had only to write
                        a letter to Sir Edward Grey and Inform his readers that he is in
                        communication with the Foreign Secretary. That alone sufficed to make him a
                        celebrity and to make his journalistic venture a success. But he did not
                        stop at this. He received a note from the Minister acknowledging the receipt
                        of his letter, and that note was pouched in gentlemanly terms. Thereupon he
                        became a great figure in the world and he sent the news to his paper from
                        Burope by wire. Sir Edward Grey he says, 'has answered my letter paying me
                        his compliments." To any European reader such an answer means nothing, of
                        course, but here it may lead thousands to the belief that the new
                        self-styled leader has almost supplanted his ival and that he has achieved
                        great things. But deception will not last seeing that "AlLewa" is openly
                        attacking the new leader's day After day.</p>
                    <p>THE “OLIVE MOOR."</p>
                    <p>There is, unfortunately, no improvement in the situation of the S.S. "Olive
                        Mode," which, as our readers know, is on the rocks some four niles
                        south-west of Agami. The weather, which we reported yesterday to be more
                        favourable, has become worse to day, and at the time of writing the wind has
                        considerably increased in force since daybreak, and the sea is uncomfortably
                        rough</p>
                    <p>Yesterday morning the jettisoning of the argo, which was resorted to in order
                        to increase the chances of getting the vessel off the rocks, was stopped,
                        after two hundred tons of argo coal and general had been thrown
                        overboard.</p>
                    <p>Surveyors and divers went out to the boat this morning to ascertain the
                        extent of the lamage, but it is feared that unless a salvage item arrives
                        within a short time the vessel will become a wreck. There can be abatement
                        in the leaking from No. 1 hold, which is already full of water, and No. 2
                        has since been equally badly affected.</p>

                        MINING IN SYRIA.</head>
                    <p>CAPITALISED BY EGYPTIANS.</p>
                    <p>A travelling correspondent writes from Beirut :</p>
                    <p>Gorged up with a transitory wealth acquired through an unusual, and to a
                        certain extent, fictitious prosperity, some Egyptian capitalists, before the
                        ebb that recently fol| lowed the flood, began to seek an outlet abroad for
                        the utilization of their superfluous financial energies. Fortunately this
                        country, so rich in natural resources yet so poor in the means of developing
                        same, bas received * relatively good share. An Egyptian of some wealth has
                        been taking an active interest in the cotton industry at Mersine, but the
                        great project whose realization might have a repercussion abroad, and more
                        directly in Egypt, is that of the asphalt mines near Lattakia. These mines
                        lie near Kerrie a village about 40 kilometres to the north east of the port
                        of Latakia, along the route leading to Jisr El Shugur, Idleb, and finally
                        Aleppo; and they constitute a geological phenomenon; as they form a part of
                        a mountain about three hundred metres high, called Jebel Kferie, near Jebel
                        El Ak. rad and Jebel Sahinn. At a height of about seventy two metres, a
                        length of 1500 metres and a width, or thickness of 1400 metres, the asphalt
                        layers extend in one immense and compact mass, estimated at about 200
                        millions tons. I have seen a sample of this asphalt, and, as far as one can
                        judge, by a superficial examination and simple fire test, it seemed to be of
                        a fairly pure quality. A well-known firm of Syrian capitalists in Beirut had
                        sought to exploit these mines a few years ago and sent out a European civil
                        engineer to survey and report thereon, but they finally gave up the project,
                        apparently judging it unremunerative. It is said that the survey was
                        superficial, and wholly inadequate, and that a good part of the asphalt
                        bearing mountain was not prospected through sheer oversight. Many years
                        before an Englishman of Constantinople, allured by these extensive surface
                        mines, had obtained the concession from the Turkish Government, and has ever
                        since been on the lookout for a syndicate to buy it up and exploit the
                        mines, until the wealthy Greek capitalist of Egypt, Mr. Zervadachi, came
                        forward to take up the scheme and exploit it on gigantic lines. It is said
                        that he bought the concession at £50,000 and that a cousin of the Khedive
                        has a share of interest in the scheme, and that he is actually working at
                        Constantinople to obtain the Imperial Firman for the light railway and
                        harbour, auxiliary schemes which are indispensable for the proper and
                        profitable exploiting of the asphalt. In enterparises of this kind the
                        question of transport is a basal element, and it is, therefore, a matter of
                        vital importance for the concessionaires of the mines to have a light
                        railway from the mine district to Latakia, and, also to make such harbour
                        works at this sea port, as would enable ships destined for the transport of
                        the mineral, to operate at all seasons, regardless of weather conditions 80
                        as to facilitate contracts with shipowners. These auxiliary enterprises were
                        sufficiently important in themselves to warrant the formation of a syndicate
                        of strong capitalists, and it is said that Mr. Zervadachi has associated in
                        the concern an Anglo German Company.</p>
                    <p>The light railway that is to connect the port of Latakia with the mines, and
                        which represents a distance of about forty kilometres, has already been
                        surveyed by a well-known English engineer from London together with a French
                        assistant. The pronouncement of this engineer, subsequent to a careful
                        inspection and remeasurement of the asphaltic layers, is said to be very
                        favourable, and preliminary negotiations have already been made for the
                        transport of the material required. It is proposed to build at Kferie about
                        a hundred huts and bungalows, for lodging the workmen and technical staff to
                        be employed on the railway, as well as a station and sheds, etc. Two plans
                        of the railway have been drawn up, and sent to the headquarters of the
                        society to be finally submitted to Constantinople. Two plans have also been
                        drawn up of the projected harbour. In one of these plans the old Roman
                        harbour is to be adhered to as much as possible and the works will involve
                        practically the repair or replacement, as the case may be, of the old Roman
                        quays, still apparent, and the dredging of the bottom of that old harbour,
                        which is now used as an anchorage for small craft and sailing vessels. This
                        old harbour lies to the South east of the town of Latakia, and the
                        breakwater will, therefore, have to be made along the Northern side, where
                        there is a line of natural rocks extending northeast of the citadel (turned
                        now into a lighthouse) until the beach. According to the first railway plan
                        it is said that the line will pass behind the town, and that the station and
                        other railway auxiliary buildings will lie to the South East.</p>
                    <p>The second harbour plan places the harbour outside the present anchorage to
                        the North East, and behind the citadel lighthouse. It will start from a
                        point called Sheikh Saeed and end in the citadel. Consequently the
                        breakwater will run in a North-easterly direction, and the railway will in
                        that case cross the Kferie valley and continue in an Easterly direction
                        until the coast passes by Wady Qandil Derr Sarho, etc. The terminus will lie
                        to the West of the town, where the railway offices, station, depots sheds,
                        etc. will be built.</p>
                    <p>THE KHEDIVE The Khedive is expected to arrive at Constantinople from Austria
                        to-day and will remain there until the end of the month. His Highness will
                        arrive at Alexandria during the first week of October</p>

                    <p>We received only a few days ago the report for 1906 of the Society for the
                        Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which, thong doing great good throughout
                        the country, is handicapped by lack of fur.ds and prevented from extending
                        its work to the degree which many of us would like to bear witness to. The
                        report for the year, however, is satisfactory, the balance sheet showing a
                        credit of L E. 496, while exceptional expenditure to the amount of LE 258
                        was incurred by the Society.</p>
                    <p>This expenditure included a sum of L E. 153 for an up-to-date ambulance,
                        grants-in-aid of L.E. 50 and L.E. 30 respectively to the Port Said and

                    <p>The financial position of the Society is now as follows :-There is a sum of
                        L.E. 1,439 standing to the credit of the Society at the Bank of Egypt, after
                        adding the surplus for 1906, i.e., LE. 496, to the accumulated surpluses of
                        former years, which amounted at the end of 1905 to L.E. 943. In addition to
                        this, the Society holds L.E. 500 of Unified Stock, producing in interest a
                        yearly sum of about L.E. 20 A further sum of L.E. 500 will now be invested
                        in Unified Stook, thus making a reserve fond of L.E. 1,000. The balance
                        remaining after the purchase of this stock will be used as a working
                        balance.</p>
                    <p>The sum received in subscriptions shows an increase of LE. 49. This is
                        accounted for by a subscription for LE. 50 received from M. Colonoff, who
                        has taken the greatest interest in the work of the Society and has promised
                        to contribute a similar sum annually. The British and other residents in
                        Cairo have shown their usual generosity in giving the Society practical
                        proof of their support</p>
                    <p>Some years ago an attempt was made through the President, for the time being,
                        of the society to induce some of the wealthier Egyptian gentlemen to
                        subscribe to its funds. A yearly sum of L.E. 18 was collected as a result of
                        his efforts, but this represented the maximum amount ever subscribed in this
                        manner, and it may be mentioned that even this sum is collected with great
                        difficulty. After deduction of the Government subvention of LE. 100, the
                        subscriptions amount to L.E. 222. Of this sum L E. 48, just about 1/5, was
                        subscribed by Egyptian gentlemen. The remaining 4/5 were subscribed by
                        Europeans, principally English officials in the service of the Egyptian
                        Government. These are by no means the wealthiest members of either the
                        European or English communities. In many cases these subscribers have
                        assisted the society from its foundation. It is a matter of great regret
                        that the wealthiest members of the communities alluded to above, should
                        apparently be indifferent to the work of the society, since not one of them
                        subscribes one piastre towards its fund. But it is still more regrettable
                        that the Egyptian community should be so conspicuous showing want of
                        support. Their attitude in Cairo is precisely the reverse of what it is it
                        the provinces as the following figures will show :</p>
                    <p>The subscriptions and donations collected from Egyptian gentlemen in 1905 by
                        the :</p>
                    <p>Fayoum S. P. C. A. amounted to L.E. 115. Mansoura 8. P. C. A. amounted to
                        L.E. 190, Tanta S. P. C. A. amounted to L.E. 183. Assiout S. P. C. A.
                        amounted to L.E. 45.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, it may be mentioned that LE. 1,200 were spent on building
                        the infirmary at Minieh-nearly the whole amount being subscribed by Egyptian
                        gentlemen.</p>
                    <p>In view of the great prosperity at present enjoyed by the inhabitants of this
                        country and of the large number of very rich men in Cairo it is a matter for
                        the greatest surprise that, ont of a total sum in subscriptions and
                        donations of LE. 464 (exclusive of the Egyptian Government subvention of
                        L.E. 100) only about LE 20 should have been contributed by Egyptians While
                        making every allowance for the difference in the point of view from which
                        Europeans, as compared with Egyptians, regard the question of cruelty to
                        animals, the fact remains, and it is not saying too much, that the Society
                        would be justified in hoping to derive an income of at least L.E. 1,000 a
                        year in subscriptions from Egyptian sources, having regard to the present
                        extent and distribution of wealth in Cairo.</p>

                    <p>Beirut, August 30. On the 21st instant there arrived by the Damascus train
                        fifty recruits destined to join the Zouave regiment of the Imperial guard.
                        These reereits will proceed by the first steamer bound for the Capital
                        accompanied by an officer of the town garrison. A</p>
                    <p>On the same day there arrived by the Russian Mail steamer "Kormloff from
                        Constantinople the Special Commission delegated for the inauguration of the
                        recently completed section of the Hedjaz grand line to Mydáyen Saleh. The
                        Commission consists of Djevad Pasha, General Auler Pasha, instructor of the
                        technical regiments, and the two sons of Tewfile Pasha, Minister of Foreign
                        Affairs. It is said that Auler Pasba was recalled from leave by Imperial
                        order to join this special commission. Prior to their departure for damascus
                        the members of this commission were the guests of Abdul Kader Effendi El
                        Dana, President of the Municipality of our town.</p>
                    <p>The inauguration ceremony will of course take 1 place on the first of
                        September, the anniversary of the accession to the throne of the Sultan.</p>
                    <p>After the performance of the ceremony it is said that General Auler Pasha
                        will make an inspection tour to Medina in order to study and report 'upon
                        the technical works involved in the final extension of the Grand Line to
                        Medina. It was the same general who some three years ago had, after the
                        inauguration of the Maan section, surveyed several sections of the Hedjaz
                        Line, and I published in book form the notes that he had taken, and that
                        embodied his views and observations on the Imperial enterprise. 1. It is
                        rumoured that the Governor of Medina also announced the departure of a
                        special delegation to attend the inauguration ceremony at Madain Saleh. Some
                        people also say thay that, judging by the rapid progress of the works, and
                        the persevering energy displayed by both officers and soldiers, the section
                        to Medina will be completed in about a year hence, and that the inauguration
                        ceremony at that seared town will then be presided by one of the sons of
