                        <p>MISS CORELLI ON MAN.</p>
                        <p> "To put it bluntly and plainly," writes Miss Marie Corelli in the
                            "Introductory Note” to her new book, "Delicia” (Constable), "a great
                            majority of the men of the present day want women to keep them. It is
                            these very men," she adds, "who at their clubs, or any other places
                            where they can give themselves sublime airs of independence, frequently
                            express regret in grandiloquent terms that there should be any women who
                            want to be clever.' Such women | are always ‘unsexed.”</p>
                        <p>"This word 'unsexed,' ' Miss Corelli continnes, “is always cast at
                            brilliant women by every little halfpenny ragamuffin of the Press that
                            can get a newspaper corner in which to hide himself for the convenience
                            of throwing stones. The woman who paints a great picture is 'unsexed';
                            the woman who writes a great book is 'unsexed'; in faet, whatever woman
                            does that is higher and more ambitious than the mere act of flinging
                            herself down at the feet of man and allowing him to walk over her, makes
                            her in man's opinion unworthy of his consideration as woman."</p>
                        <p>"What," Miss Corelli asks, "are the occupations man graciously permits to
                            woman without affronting her by this opprobious epithet. He is chiefly
                            willing to see her on the stage. And he generally prefers the music hall
                            stage as the best one fitted to her poor' abilities. It is no particular
                            'fun' to him to see her rise to the histrionic height of a Rachelor a
                            Sarah Bernhardt. Nor does the exquisite grace of the finished
                            'comedienne' delight him entirely. No ! Neither the height of tragedy
                            nor comedy in the woman on the stage really satisfy men so | much as the
                            happy medium-the particular 'no-man's-land' of art, where nothing is
                            demanded of her but-body and grin. A beantiful | body, trained to walk
                            and look well--an affable grin, expanding at the sight of champagne and
                            other mundane delicacies--these are all that is necessary.</p>
                        <p>"Now, if this beautiful body be well-nigh stripped to man's gaze night
                            after night on the boards, he will never call the woman who so exposes
                            herself 'unsexed, nor will he apply the word to her if she drinks too
                            much wine and brandy. But if another woman, with quite AS beautiful a
                            body, instead of exhibiting | herself half nude on the music hall stage,
                            prefers to keep her woman's modesty, and execute some great work of art
                            which shall be | as good and even better than anything man can
                            accomplish, she will be dubbed 'unsexed instantly.</p>
                        <p>"I ask-Why is it that man elects to compass woman's degradation rather
                            than hec uplifting and sanctification ?"</p>
                        <p>Miss Corelli alludes to "a certain individual, looked upon with a
                            considerable amount of respect by the titled and monied classes, who
                            married a bright little woman for her money, and since then has made her
                            life an hourly misery." Miss Corelli also speaks of the miserable
                            position voluntarily held by certain 'noblemen' who, because they have
                            placed themselves in the unnatural and unbecoming condition of owing
                            everything to their wives' money, permit those wives to play fast and |
                            loose with their honour and good name, and apparently shut their eyes to
                            the shameless infidelities which make them the by-word and contempt of
                            all self-respecting 'commoners.'</p>
                        <p>"It would be a wholesome and refreshing stimulus to society,” she adds,
                            "if such 'blueblooded lacqueys could awake to the fact that manbood is
                            better than money, and would by their own free will and choice go out to
                            hard | labour in the goldfields or elsewhere and earn their own
                            livelihood bravely and independently, instead of lounging and frittering
                            their days away, the silent and inactive spectators of | their wives'
                            open and wanton degradation."</p>

                        <p>'There are some signs which render it probable that the settlement of the
                            trade difficulties, which were recently reported to exist owing to the
                            troubles in which some Cairo firms found themselves, is likely to fall
                            through. There was a meeting yesterday at Manchester to consider the policy
                            that should be followed at the present juncture. The practical results of
                            the meeting were unsatisfactory, as it is found to be a difficult business
                            to bring the various parties interested into line.</p>

                        <p>GOLD IN SINAI.</p>
                        <p>In Egypt proper between the 22nd and 28th parallels of north latitude gold is
                            now known to be widely distributed in both the older sedimentary and
                            plutonic rocks, and more especially in the neighbourhood of, or actually in
                            the less acid granites (hornblende granites), quartzdiorites, and diorites
                            which often appear to form well-defined zones, near the junction of the
                            granites with the ancient sedimentaries. As rocks of the last named type are
                            largely developed in Eastern Sinai, the report on that part of Egypt, which
                            has just been issued by the Survey Department, contains an interesting
                            account of their distribution, and may prove of material aid to the
                            prospector.</p>
                        <p>In many cases despite the large number of ancient workings, it has been most
                            difficult to obtain even traces of gold at the surface, but deeper
                            excavations have led to the finding of rich one bodies in some of the
                            Egyptian mines. The want of superficial deposits is largely accounted for by
                            the removal of the outcrops and weathered portions of auriferous bodies by
                            the ancients, and in any case patient search and study of the various
                            formations has been necessary to locate the old shutes ; such work does not
                            come within the functions of a rapid geological survey, whose object must be
                            to lay a wide general foundation on which more detailed research may be
                            based.</p>
                        <p>Summarizing with regard to the occurrence of gold in Sinai it may be stated
                            :--</p>
                        <p>1. That the similarity of the formations to those of the Eastern Deserts of
                            Egypt is a hopeful indication that auriferous deposits will occur.</p>
                        <p>2. Only a systematic search by prospectors can prove the existence or
                            non-existence of gold.</p>
                        <p>3. The quartz region near the foot of Gebel Abu Mesud may be indicated as one
                            of the most likely spots at which to commence such an exploration.</p>
                        <p>From time to time expeditions have been made by various exploring parties
                            into the Sinai Peninsula, but unfortunately but little of their data has
                            been published.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                        <p>Sir, I notice a paragraph in your issue of yesterday's date under the above
                            heading in which the astounding statement is made that 120,000 tourists had
                            visited Egypt last winter season, and had spent in his (Mr. Summers)
                            estimation 18 millions sterling !! Taking all the hotels in Egypt, including
                            Alexandria, Port Said, Cairo, Luxor, and Assouan, that cater for the tourist
                            trade, a total of five thousand beds would be a very liberal estimate, and
                            taking that each one of these beds was occupied for 100 nights during the
                            season, also a liberal estimate, we would have a total of 500,000 beds
                            occupied for one night each, or if you' give each tourist an average stay of
                            25 days we would have a total number of 20,000 tourists ; half that number
                            instead of 120,000 is probably the correct figure. Again if you allow for
                            each tourist and expenditure of two "pounds per day, the above calculation
                            would amount to one million sterling instead of eighteen millions. I once
                            heard a native proverb which roughly translated says "a hungry man dreams of
                            loaves of bread". Mr. Montague Summers, if correctly reported, must have
                            surely been indulging in a summer's daydream.</p>

                        <p>[We believe that the total number of first class passengers, which almost
                            entirely include the tourist class, who landed in Egypt last season, did not
                            exceed 12,000. Ed. E.G.)</p>

                        <head>OKAPI IN THE SUDAN</head>
                        <p>A note in the "Bulletin," of the Paris Museum, indicates that Captain (now
                            Colonel) Marchand, of Fashoda fame, was the first European to see that
                            interesting African ani. mal, the Okapi, alive. Some extracts are given from
                            the journal kept by Captain Marchand on his expedition from the Congo to
                            Fashoda. From these it appears that on the southern watershed of the
                            Bahr-el-Ghazal, Marchand saw in a herd of antelopes a creature such as he
                            had never seen before. It had a giraffe-like Deck and horns, the body was
                            reddish brown in colour, while the limbs and hind-quarters were striped.
                            This was in 1898. From the description, Professor Menegaux, who writes the
                            note, is convinced that the unknown creature was the Okapi, which was thus
                            seen for the first time in the flesh by a European.</p>

                        <head>PROSPECTS OF THE FLOOD.</head>
                        <p>During the last two or three days a rise of about one metre has taken place
                            in the level of the Atbara River. This rise has been sustained and may
                            possibly improve the levels generally. The flood, however, up to now
                            considered as a whole seems so far as can be judged up to the present date,
                            to be some a what late in its coming. What has arrived is below the average.
                            This slight lateness of the flood will not affect the cotton crop or the
                            watering of the sharaki lands, as the irrigation of these cultivations are
                            proceeding in a satisfactory manner from the good supplies of water sent
                            down by the Assouan Reservoir.</p>
                        <p>The critical period may be said to be the first 10 days of August, as the
                            volume of the flood depends on the level attained by the Blue Nile at say,
                            Roseires, being maintained for sufficient time in August. In 1903 the river
                            on August 12 rose to &amp; gauge reading of 20-8 metres and then fell slowly
                            throughout the month. In 1904 it rose to 20-5 metres on July 31, then tell
                            abruptly, 18-5 metres being mean for August in that year. On the ground of
                            this and other information the prediction was made last year at the
                            beginning of August that the Hood would be near the average, and that no
                            grounds existed for expecting that it would exceed it to any extent. In the
                            case of last year's flood, the general character of this period of six weeks
                            1 July 15 August was that the supply, which was below the average at first,
                            improved rapidly towards the end.</p>
                        <p>Last year the Atbara at Khashm el Girba rose markedly at the end of July and
                            the early part of August, so that at Wadi Halfa the level reached the mean
                            of the 15 years 1890-1904 in August, but did not exceed it until the end of
                            the month.</p>

                            we will not attempt to deal with his report in one issue, to do which would
                            require too much generalisation to do justice to so important a branch of
                            the Municipal Administration.</p>
                        <p>THE POPULATION.-Dr. Gotschlich first gives a few details of the population of
                            Alexandria, which, he estimates, was on July, 1, 1906, 400,159, of which
                            332,586 were native inhabitants, and 67,566 foreigners.</p>
                        <p>He points out, however, that these figures cannot be vouched for as accurate,
                            they being based upon the census of 1897 and the calculation of the increase
                            in population being proportional to the increase of birth rate, but the
                            great difficulty in ascertaining with accuracy the number of births must be
                            remembered, there being no law compelling Europeans to register. It can be
                            taken for granted, however, that the figure given is the minimum. Though in
                            all probability the birth rate has a tendency to decrease, there is every
                            indication that immigration has greatly increased. Upon sach bases Dr.
                            Gotschlich Estimates that the death rate, instead of being 29.2%, as by the
                            figures adopted, is probably 28.7%.</p>
                        <p>BIRTHS. During 1906, 13,937 native births were registered, as compared with
                            the average of 12,743 for the years 1901 to 1905. Of these 13,641 were
                            Mohamedans and 896 natives of other religions. According to the register of
                            baptisms, however, the births of non-Mohamedans totalled 1,083, so that at
                            least 17% were not made known to the sanitary authorities. Of births of
                            foreigners only 668 were declared, while the baptism registries give a total
                            of 1,571.</p>
                        <p>DEATHS. The deaths during 1906 totalled 11,683, of which 10,755 were natives,
                            and the average death rate for the last decade is given as 31.2 %, while the
                            average from 1901 to 1906 is 29:6 %. The highest figure during this latter
                            period is registered for 1902 when the cholera epidemic largely accounted
                            for a death rate of 34.3 %. In 1906 the actual number of deaths among adults
                            was normal and it has been almost constant since 1901 ; and seeing that it
                            is the adult population and not the infant population, owing to immigration,
                            which is increasing, the death rate among adults is decreasing and therefore
                            it may be assumed that the sanitary | conditions are improving. The death
                            rate among native infants is almost 66 % and among foreign infants it is
                            only 83% The number of deaths before the age of one year WAS 4,006 native
                            and 193 European, with respective averages during the last five years of
                            3,630 and 183. From one to five years old the figures are 2,667 (average
                            2,552) natives, and 105 (average 127) Europeans.</p>
                        <p>INFECTIOUS DISEASES. — During 1906 there were in all 97 cases of plague
                            recorded, 62 of which (64%) terminated fatally, but of these 62 only 7 were
                            Europeans, among whom 18 cases were declared. 186 cases of diphtheria were
                            notified and of these 94 (51%) died : practically 50% of the cases were
                            natives, but among them the mortality was far heavier in in proportion, 63
                            out of 92 being fatal cases. of the 132 typhoid fever cases notified 64 |
                            were Europeans, 59 Egyptians, and 9 Ottoman subjects, the deaths being
                            respectively 31, 51, and 7. The death rate from typhoid, therefore, among
                            Europeans was about 50% | while among the natives it was almost 100%. 92
                            cases of small-pox were notified, of which 36 terminated fatally. There were
                            631 deaths from tuberculosis among the natives and 83 Europeans died from
                            this disease.</p>
                        <p>On the subject of infectious diseases Dr. Gotschlich says:</p>
                        <p>It is satisfactory to note that the frequency of infectious diseases has
                            diminished during 1906 very remarkably, if one compares the figures of
                            deaths for that year with those of 19 3 to 19' 5. Diphtheria alone shows a
                            slight increase, though without reaching the level of 1905, while all the
                            others show a considerable decrease."</p>
                        <p>For 1907, however, we shall most certainly see higher figures both as regards
                            the plague and small-pox.</p>
                        <p>The figures for hydrophobia are very interesting and it is notable that last
                            year no death from this fatal disease was recorded. In 1905 there were 19
                            mad animals, 28 people bitten, and 2 deaths; in 1903 there were 16 mad
                            animals, 36 people bitten, and 4 deaths; and 111906 there were 4 mad
                            animals, 4 persons bitten, and no deaths.</p>

                        <p>The Paris newspapers report that Captain Arnaud, of the Colonial Infantry,
                            has succeeded in marching from Algiers to Kotonu, on the coast of Dahomey,

                        <p>He covered a distance of 8120 miles, including over 700 miles over a new
                            ronte. The expedition met with no opposition.-Reuter.</p>
                        <p>With this may be compared the 1700 miles joumey last autumn from Tripoli

                        <p> His progress was much slower, as he took about 460 days over the 1700 miles,
                            as against the Frenchman's 127 days for 3120 miles ; but it must be
                            remembered that Mr. Vischer was a civilian, and travelled with an ordinary

                    <head>THE MAKING OF BYE-LAWS.</head>
                    <head>BY R. WILLIAMS F.R I B.A.</head>
                    <p> In the making of laws or bye-laws, any regulation which primarily should
                        tend to har monize the varied amenities of life, the greatest care is
                        needed, lest by any chance, legislators, national or local, should by their
                        law or regulation making, play into the hands of selfishness and greed. In
                        all laws and bye-laws there must be room for the foll play of honest
                        discretion and, above all, of equity.</p>
                    <p>As an illustration of what is meant above, let us take the question of the
                        foundation of a wall which abuts a neighbour's land. That is to say, a
                        proprietor desires to build upon bis boundary. Now, it is a well known fact
                        (not a mere theory of the axiom) that unless a wall has a foundation,
                        considerably broader than the breadth or thickness of the superincumbent
                        wall, it will be unsafe. But in order that the proprietor should be able to
                        realise, without detriment to his neighbour, the full benefit of his land he
                        must be allowed to build the projecting part of his foundation (below the
                        surface of the ground) upon his neighbour's land. This can be done without
                        harm to the neighbour, but the refusal to allow this accomodation can be, as
                        pointed out already, harmful to the proprietor who wants build.</p>
                    <p>Under the London Building Act, all that is required is a notice to the
                        adjoining owner that that proprietor is going to build and will put footings
                        on the adjoining owner's land. This is only reasonable. But strange as it
                        may seem here in Egypt, where long before the days of Herodotus (who noticed
                        the aberration) it is still the custom to do things inversely. The Oairo
                        Tanzim, SO my builder informs me, refused to allow him to put the footings
                        of a wall he was building at Port Said on the land of the adjoining owner.
                        This is, I am told, a Tanzim regulation. A regulation, be it understood,
                        calculated to make of a new building a dangerous structure. Herein is
                        another hint to the Alexandria bye-law makers.</p>
                    <p>Take another case. A case where preeminently equity should play the more
                        prominent part. A manufacturer having established a business, which, for
                        between forty and fifty years he has honourably conducted and to the benefit
                        of Egypt and of Egyptians, finds himself in this late day, being overreached
                        by a neighbour who, presuming upon bis knowledge that a building roksa or
                        permit bad not been obtained by the manufacturer, proceeded to build some
                        cottages on land near by and to promptly object to the proximity of workshop
                        premises ! The neglect to obtain a roksa by the manufacturer can well be
                        understood as he was established before the days of modern roksas. But what
                        would be the result, supposing the object neighbour should gain his point.
                        He will be able to buy the land deserted by the workshops at a cheap
                        rate.</p>
                    <p>The case of the footings can be dealt with effectively in a bye-law, but the
                        latter case is one (and many similar cases may arise, for selfishness and
                        greed often goes to inordinate | lengths) which requires the utmost wisdom,
                        and can only be decided by the universal law which Emerson called “the law
                        of give and take" but which was better said by another teacher in the words,
                        "Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you."</p>
                    <p>Building laws are the result of compromise between conflicting causes. On the
                        one hand our experience of trade and of life generally make certain demands
                        on space, construction and sanitary arrangement; and on the other hand there
                        is the question of cost, value of land and return on capital outlay. These
                        considerations are in conflict, consequently the resulting laws always fall
                        short of the true ideal. It is permissible to say that did we but realise
                        the highest ideals with regard to our lives, laws would not be required.</p>
                    <p>Ancient Rome had its building laws as Vitruvius tells us, yet in the days of
                        Augustus there was a crowding of tall buildings in narrow streets and a
                        crowding of people within the buildings, accompanied by the resulting
                        insanitation and disease.</p>
                    <p>The London building and health laws are among the most comprehensive of all
                        such laws, yet crowding is rampant.</p>
                    <p>In the making of building laws, Alexandria | has a special advantage. Its
                        Municipality can profit by the failures and experience of other cities, but
                        while we recognise this, we must not forget that Alexandria is beset with
                        other than the usual set of difficulties. The Capitulations present no small
                        hindrance to the proper working of a sanitary and building code. Yet we may
                        well suppose that for the benefit of the city in which they (some of them)
                        make their fortunes and occasionally lose them, the beneficiaries by the
                        Capitulations will surely brush aside all difficulties on that hend, and
                        give to the Municipality 'a free hand in the making of laws for the health
                        and safety and shall we say, beauty, of the town.</p>
                    <p>The essentials of the necessary bye-laws may be enumerated as follows -</p>
                    <p>1. The laying out of streets and of rainage, and of sewerage.</p>
                    <p>2. Naming streets.</p>
                    <p> 3. Open spaces.</p>
                    <p> 4. Construction.</p>
                    <p> 5. Dangerous structures.</p>
                    <p> 6. Temporary structures.</p>
                    <p> 7. Dangerous businesses and factories</p>
                    <p>8. Duties of superintending architect, chief engineer and building
                        inspectors</p>
                    <p>9. Procedure as to building notices.</p>
                    <p> In my next paper I shall deal with the first three points, with especial
                        reference to the voluminous and exhaustive report of the Royal Comission on
                        London Traffic, a work from which the Municipality of Alexandria may gather
                        many useful hints.</p>

                     <head>IS HE A MINOR POET</head>
                     <p>Mr. Wilfrid Blunts recent book, on Egypt has led to a dicussion in the
                         "Athenaeum" of: the rights and responsibilities of the historian and to
                         certain criticisms in the Times" and “Punch” which have called down the
                         Wrath of the "Academy." This paper, in its issue of July 6, says :-"The
                         Times” has no more right to call Mr. Blunt a minor poet then it i has to
                         call Byron &amp; minor poet, less right indeed. It was the "Times" I
                         understand which when 'In Memoriam' was anonymously published, referred to
                         it as this touching -poem, evidently the work of the widow o n military
                         man,' and it will be the "Times undoubtedly who, if and when a new Keata
                         arises in the land, will tell him to go back to his gallipots. "IL," adds
                         the writer, "the "Times" has not the sense to see that Mr. Blant is not a
                         'minor poet, it might at least appreciate that he is probably one of the
                         greatest masters of English prose that has appeared in the last hundred
                         years."</p>
