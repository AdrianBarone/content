                    <p>EGYPTIAN UNREST</p>
                    <p>Sir Edward Grey has spoken, and his speech may be fairly said to express what
                        many Anglo-Egyptians have thought for months past and have not dared to
                        express, through a fear of seeming to be afraid. The situation has become
                        unpleasant since the demonstration of the allied fleets at Mitylene resulted
                        in the despatch to Egypt of a force of agents-provocateurs, and in our
                        opinion, Sir Edward Grey has done well to treat it seriously. It may be
                        objected that there is no evidence for the increase throughout North Africa
                        of "religious" movement aiming at the expulsion of foreigners. We cannot
                        speak with any authority of the state of affairs in Algeria and Tanis; we
                        only know that in the last-named province some anxiety has been caused by
                        the proceedings of the numerous Moslem fraternities, especially the powerful
                        Madani sect Morocco is, of course, opposed to European interference of any
                        sort, and it may be taken for granted that the wild tribes of the Sahara
                        are, as ever, the enemies of all that stands for civilization and settled
                        government. From Tripoli comes the news that the Turkish Government has
                        forbidden the interior to European explorers and travelers, and that a
                        movement in making way in Fezzan, Baron, and Tripoli proper aiming at an
                        understanding between the Turkish rulers and the Arab and Kabyle
                        fraternities of the province.</p>
                    <p>In Egypt, we have witnessed the first and we wish we could hope the last
                        stirrings of a Pan-Islamic movement. The outbreaks at Alexandria, the
                        violent and unchecked tirades of the "Nationalist" Press, the direction of
                        school strikes by agitators, the frontier dispute with its train of
                        consequences, the increase of the Army of Occupation and the ultimatum to
                        Turkey, the appeals made to the Egyptian Army by the most fanatical of the
                        Nationalist journals, the painful incident at Danishwai, and the agitation
                        to which it gave rise, bare made the year interesting if agitated. But
                        however pleasant it may be for a journalist to feel that at last something
                        is happening in an upoventful country, his pleasure is not abared by the
                        official, the businessman, and the trader, and indeed by all the stable
                        elements of Egyptian society. They want no disturbances and no agitation,
                        and whatever their sympathies, they are likely to be reassured by Sir B.
                        Grey's statement that Great Britain is prepared, should the necessity arise,
                        to support the local authorities by means that may be perforce
                        unconstitutional.</p>
                    <p>We commend Sir E. Gray's speech to those who by daily tirades are doing their
                        best to excite ill-feeling tetween Egyptians and the subjeots of the
                        occupying Power, and to that ignoble if less dangerous class which insults
                        Europeans when in a large majority, toasts the Denishwai criminals, and in
                        it, every action shows itself "willing to wound" but very much "afraid to
                        strike." To the Pan-Islamic Press it gives a warning that the role of agent
                        provocateur may one day prove dangerous. To those who desire a revival of
                        the days of Ismail and Arabi, it opposes the inflexible determination of the
                        British people to preserve the nascent civilisation of Egypt from the forces
                        of shiftless barbarism and medieval bigotry.</p>

The trial of the ac cused will take place in the Native Tribunals, the case being considered as an ordinary one of assault. A rumor was current in town yesterday that Private O'Brien had succumbed to his injuries at Rass el Tin Hospital, but we are lad to learn on enquiry that he is as well as can be expected under the circumstances. The rumour arose from the fact that another patient in the hospital died, and as the gun carriage conveying his body to the cemetery passed through the main streets the mistaken conclusion was arrived at that the Mex incident had ended fatally, which happily is not the case. </p>

                        <p>Advantage is being taken of the quiet summer months by the directors of Shepboard's Hotel to add to and considerably improve this popular hostelry. The addition of a third floor which is at present being built will provide accommodation for nearly a hundred extra guests. This floor will include besides the bedrooms, twenty-two bathrooms with lavatories, etc. The grill-room is being enlarged by the addition of the space hitherto given over to the garden terrace, and from this will be built another large terrace, five metres in width, while a new corridor is being constructed on as to connect it directly with the kitchens, Another great improvement is the addition of the extra nine metres to the large mi in dining-room. A distinct improvement will also be made in the present offices of the directors and a small part of the ladies' drawing room will be converted into the manager’s office. A large lift is being constructed for visitors and a small one for luggage so that the hotel will in future be provided with three lifts instead of only one. On the new third story two spacious, cupola-shaped balconies are being built.

                      <dateline>London, July 6</dateline>
                      <p> HOUSE, OF COMMONS -Sir E. Grey, in an important statement on the foreign
                            policy of the Government, emphasized the value, and unaggressive
                            character, of the alliance with Japan and the entente with France. The
                            latter, be said, would be unimpaired by other developments of Great
                            Britain's policy. He reminded King Leopold that other people had rights
                            in the Congo. Ho distrusted the efficacy of the projected reforms and
                            said that Britain would readily join with other Powers in pressing for a
                            change of the system of government, but, in view of the remarkable and
                            welcome change in the attitude of the Belgian Parliament and people, and
                            the desirability of Belgium taking over the Congo, be preferred to wait
                            before committing the Government to any definite steps. </p>
                        <p>He justified the visit of the Fleet to Kronstadt and said that it would
                            be exceedingly inappropriate not to visit the Russian porta in the
                            Baltic which had not been visited in 1905. He was in possession of
                            trustworthy information to the effect that the Russian Central
                            Government had not connived at the massacres. </p>
                        <p>The visit was arranged long since, entirely without reference to Russian
                            affairs, in a friendly spirit to the Tsar, the Russian Government, and
                            people. He cannot imagine the Duma interpreting the visit as our taking
                            sides, which would appear to be the case if we now abandoned it. In his
                            opinion, the only safe role with regard to Russian troubles was to avoid
                            comment or interference. </p>

                      <p>HOUSE OF COMMONS -In last nights' debate on Foreign Policy Sir E. Grey said that the Japanese Alliance was enjoying "exceedingly good health." Japan was devoting her remarkable energy and public spirit to guiding Korea, and to the development of her own resources. The Alliance gives a sense of mutual security to each without being of serious anxiety to anybody else. He trusted that it would long remain so.</p>

                    <p>Sensational Speech in the Commons</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Greys Appeal</p>
                    <p>The Meaning of Denishwai</p>

                        <p>Sir E. Grey begged the House not to pass a hasty judgment with regard to
                            the Danishwai executions and not to embark on a discussion of such a
                            serious subject at present. He emphasized the fact of the newspaper
                            reports of the executions being inaccurate and deprecated any unfairness
                            towards Egyptian officials, whom he eulogised. What was more serious was
                            that all this year fanaticism in Egypt had been increasing and was not
                            confined to Egypt alone, but was spreading throughout the North of
                            Africa. The attack on British officers would never have occurred a
                            little while ago. Since this attack, other significant attacks had been
                            made on Europeans. “We may be on the eve of farther measures necessary
                            for the protection of Europeans in Egypt, and, if the House at this
                            moment weakens or destroys the authority of the Egyptian Government, you
                            will be face to face with a most serious situation, because, if
                            fanaticism in Egypt overcomes the authority of the Egyptian Government,
                            extreme measures will be necessary. We may be forced at any moment to
                            take unconstitutional measures which we should be bound to take in an
                            emergency." Sir E.Grey's speech created a profound sensation and was
                            listened to in silence, broken only by occasional approving cheers. Mr.
                            Keir Hardie said that in view of the Foreign Secretary’s appeal, he
                            would not diss the matter further. Lord Cromer was present during the
                            debate. </p>

                            <p> In view of Sir Edward Grey's speech, the remarks of the “Daily Telegraph” 
                                in reference to the Danishwai affair are extremely à propos. Our London 
                                contemporary says:-” Peculiar interest and significance attached to this 
                                care, which intrinsically might be regarded as being of merely local 
                                importance, by reason of the subterranean unrest in Egypt, which has
                                been recorded for some month past by the politico-seismological machine
                                at Cairo. There is no doubt a considerable section of Egyptians who would 
                                strengthen Turkish influence at the expense of English in the territories
                                of the Khedive. The increase of the Imperial forces in the Khediviate when 
                                the Akabah crisis threatened to become acute was due, not to fear of 
                                anything the Sultan might do, but to our knowledge of the excitement aroused
                                in the minds of the Egyptians by the crisis itself. The danger, such as it
                                was added another proof that amongst Oriental religious fanaticism is apt
                                to override all considerations of material advantage and prosperity. The 
                                same phenomenon was accountable for the troubles in Morocco. Bat the fast
                                is more strange in Egypt. The fellah has had an experience of government 
                                by Turkish pashas; under their role, he was ill-treated, compelled to 
                                labour without wages on works unproductive as well as productive, in which 
                                he had no personal interest, lived under a hopelessly corrupt judicial 
                                system, which cared for no law but that of "backsheesh "; he was miserably
                                poor, the prey of the greediest moneylenders in the world, and had about
                                as miserable an existence as fell to the lot of any semi-civilized creature.
                                England and Lord Cromer have changed all that. The corvée is abolished, 
                                the kourbash has, except for criminals, no longer any terrors; justice is
                                administered with stern impartiality; taxes have been reduced to as nearly 
                                a minimum as possible; the credit of the country is as good at that of the 
                                wealthiest Power in Europe; irrigation, which supplies the bread of life 
                                to the dwellers on the Nile, has been extended to a degree undreamt of by 
                                the most enterprising Pharaohs, and all the resources of the country are 
                                being developed marvelously, largely by the assistance of British capital,
                                which would have hardly been forthcoming had not the City and the capitalist
                                had unbounded confidence in Lord Cromer's wisdom and administrative genius.
                                Yet it cannot be denied that amongst the classes most favored by our 
                                protectorate there are some whose fanaticism blinds them to their own interest
                                as well as to the general regeneration of their ancient country; men who
                                would rather starve under the profligate extravagance of a Mursalman Ismail
                                than live in plenty provided by the wide counsels of an English Christian.
                                There can be no doubt that Turkish intrigue has been pushed very far whether 
                                by the Sultan himself or by dangerous advisers there is no means of 
                                determining. This much, however, is certain that since Russia's failure in
                                the Far East and the beginning of her domestic difficulties, Abdul Hamid has
                                divested himself of that daily and nightly terror with which the power of his
                                nearest neighbor inspired him. But the Saltan is a man of great experience 
                                and great cunning, and know that today, in spite of all the alleged 
                                disaffection in the Russian army and navy, the Tear, if he were so disposed,
                                could sweep down on Constantinople and pluck it like a ripe fruit. He knows
                                that Russia is on better terms with England than she has ever been and that
                                just as she has always disavowed in her happy times-any particular interest 
                                in Egypt, it is notorious that England would not move a gunboat to save 
                                Constantinople for the Turks. These considerations should give pause to that 
                                anti-English party in Egypt which has always been feeble, and which since the 
                                conclusion of the Anglo-French convention has become utterly hopeless. </p>

                        <p>The“Berliner Neueste Nachrichten" concludes an article entitled "The Saltan in his African 
                            Vilayet," which deals with the Pan-Islamic revival in North Africa and the recent Turko 
                            Egyptian Frontier Question, by the following remarks:-"Itis likely enough that the
                            Senoussi Mahdi and his fanatical adherents are about to make their presence felt. At 
                            present a movement, which should be veiled, is manifesting itself openly in Tripoli. 
                            The fact at least that the Ottoman Government has ordered the authorities of Tripoli
                            and Benghazi to refuse the usual permits to travel in the interior to foreign explorers
                            and travellers, seems conclusive as to this point. All this is food for thought, the more 
                            so at a moment when news comes of disturbances in the Sudan which, despite official
                            assurances, may not be purely local in their character."</p>

                        <p>"Al Mokattam's" correspondent in Alexandria writes to his paper to the
                            effect that enlightened natives are of opinion that the recent attack
                            against a British soldier by some natives of a very low class at Mex was
                            mostly due to inflammatory tirades of a section of the native Press. </p>
                        <p>A native notable says, continues the writer, that the English will not be
                            quite justified in punishing ignorant and low-class people for crimes
                            inspired by misleading newspapers, and leaving their guides unpunished.
                            The former are blind, the latter their guides, and the mischievous
                            newspapers which they edit should be suppressed. Egypt, remarks the
                            writer, is the only country in the world where the ignorant and
                            uncultured are allowed to publish "rags" which they call newspapers, and
                            which they use to acquire money by blackmail. The publishers of such
                            misleading papers, which can produce nothing but ignorance and
                            inaccuracy, are not, really, to be blamed for their errors, which are
                            natural as long as they are themselves uneducated and unpolished. The
                            British occupants of Egypt are alone responsible for the effects of the
                            misleading or mischievous statements that always appear in those papers. </p>

                        <head>The Callicopoulo Affair</head>
                        <p>Dr. J. Kérassotis has addressed a long letter to a Cairo contemporary
                            describing the condition of the servant girl Irene whom he was called in
                            to attend after her torture by Callicopoulor and attempting to explain
                            his failure to warn the authorities. This admirable physician writes :
                            "According to French medical law, which I studied, a doctor is not
                            obliged to warn the authorities of a case of crime or cruelty but is
                            free to act in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience. I was
                            therefore under no obligation to inform the Hellonio Consulate; nor is
                            it fair to state that I neglect ed to give information, since, on
                            visiting the house next morning. I found the consular authorities there,
                            none of whom could give spy opinion as to my decision whether to
                            denounce or not to denounce the guilty parties. It is not true that the
                            girl was taken to hospital after 10 days' illness. She was carried to
                            Dr. Milton's hospital on the day of my diagnosis." </p>
                        <p>Dr. Kérassotis concludes with a peroration concerning the duties of his

                  <head>Egyptian Prosperity</head>
                  <p>Mr. W. M. S. Selwyn, of the Commercial Intelligence Bureau, writes to the "Globe":- “In reference
                      to the very interesting 'City Notas' on the prosperity of Egypt, which we must have made their
                      proper impression in financial circles, it may be suggested that it is of the highest importance
                      for British capital to be employed to the fullest possible extent in the development of this land 
                      of riches, and to prevent foreign speculators securing an Influence in the country which might be 
                      to our political disadvantage later on. The question is-is the profitable exploitation of Egypt
                      to fell to the British, who have risked so much here, or to the French, the Germans, the Italians,
                      and the Greeks, all of whom would Constitute foreign element which, there is Ivory reason to believe,
                      might seriously harass British rule. We have already had experience of anti-British intriguer in the
                      country, and it is incumbent upon us to secure that in the future we shall have an unquestioned 
                      predominance over all other European nationalities. It happens, fortunately, that the fulfillment 
                      of this desirable political object requires no heroic political measures, but simply the application 
                      to the problem of an enterprising commercial spirit. Let the fruitful lands of the Delta be in British,
                      not foreign, hands. This would add stability to the British occupation, and at the same time pay money 
                      into British pockets."

                    <head>Promotion of Hellenic Studies</head>
                    <p>Professor Percy Gardner presided last week at the annual meeting of the Society for
                        the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, held at Burlington House. The report read by Mr. 
                        George A. Macmillan, the hon. secretary referred to the loss sustained by the society
                        in the death of the late President, Sir Richard Claverhouse Jebb. An important departure
                        in the constitution was the creation of Student Associates. The Council had long felt
                        that there was a class of younger students specially interested in the objects of the
                        society, and by inclination and training likely to be useful members, who were debarred
                        owing to the entrance fee from coming forward as candidates. Professor Gardner in his
                        address spoke of the progress made in recent discoveries in that branch of Hellenic
                        learning which is concerned with the remains of ancient Greece. He pointed out that
                        although excavations had proceeded many Greek sites such as Ephesus, Lindys, Pergamus,
                        and Miletus, striking discoveries had been few. The discoveries at ancient Sparta, made
                        by Mr. Bosanqnet and his colleagues at the British School at Athens, gave great hope for 
                        the future, and this place had now been made over to the English as a place of research,
                        The Athenino Acropolis was dearest to them as phil Hellenes. During the year that sacred
                        site had somewhat changed its appearance through the partial restoration of the Erechtheium. 
                        No question had been more discussed in archeological circles than the propriety of rebuilding
                        the partly surviving temples of Greece. The Parthenon had only been repaired to prevent its 
                        falling, but the question was not whether more pillars should be set up, but whether some
                        of the sculptured freize which still remained in situ should be removed and placed in the
                        museum since it seemed to be perishing from the action of the climate. Professor Garder 
                        was elected president for five years, and Mr. Caoil Snith, Keeper of the Department of
                        Greek and Roman Antiquities in the British Museum, gave an illustrated communication on

                    <div type="item">
                        <p>A PATHETIC incident arose on one occasion at a church in Longton, Staff, when the lady organist suddenly collapsed at service and fell in a swoon. That event was recalled at an interview which press representative recently had with the lady, Mrs. J. Made'ey. who resides at 45, Dunrobin-street, Longton.
                            “The incident," she stated, "was the result of ill-health, and though it occurred some years ago I still have vivid recollections of my sufferings. I suffered from acute indigestion with great pain after meals, and a sense of oppression like choking.
                            "I dieted myself and ate less and less, yet every morsel of, food punished me severely. I sought medical advice, but to me it seemed only a waste of money. Then came shooting pains between my shoulders and down my back. My body never seemed free from pain. If I went upstairs or walked up a bill my heart would beat furiously. For months I was never without throbbing pains of neuralgia in my head. I seemed to be in a maze all day long. I had continual noises in the ears, with attacks of dizziness and faintness. Through deficiency of blood, I lost energy. Tired and languid by day, and without rest at night, I became painfully weak.
                            "One day while at the church organ, I was overcome with an attack of dizziness and fainted away. I was taken out into the fresh air, and there recovered from the swoon, but for a long time, I felt the effects of this. Eventually, my life became a daily martyrdom; weak and bloodless from anemia and racked by pains, I was a picture of misery and helplessness.
                            "Luckily a friend earnestly advised me to try Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, so I purchased
                            A box, and before long was surprised to find myself more cheerful and taking an interest in life. As I continued the pills my food nourished me. I would feel the glow of new life in my body. I slept soundly at night; the pains disappeared, my appetite increased, and health came back. Soon I was quite well again. My eyes were bright, my complexion clear, and I was strong."
