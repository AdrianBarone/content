                    <head>BRITISH FLOUR FOR EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>In an article on Egypt's increasing importations of flour the “Miller” says :
                        A short time ago we briefly commented upon the fact that although Egypt was
                        importing larger quantities of wheat flour every year the British miller was
                        not increasing his share of the trade in a corresponding ratio, Roughly
                        speaking Egypt now takes over a million .sack- yearly, and there is no
                        apparent reason why the United Kingdom should net have a better showing
                        against other countries, and especially against the French miller, who up to
                        the present has had the lion's share of the trade with 700,000 sacks for
                        last year compare: with 70,000 sacks originating here. This is 10 to one in
                        sporting parlance, and the odd, are too long. It is quite true that our
                        millers have doubled their quantity during last yea: seeing that in 1905
                        only 34,000 sacks were sent out, and there is nothing, or should be nothing,
                        to prevent a still greater increase. The imports into Egypt of no other
                        article during the last two years show such a great increase as flour and
                        grain of various sorts. Of course, we remember that opportunity served very
                        well, seeing that these years were of the lean kind in Egypt, both wheat and
                        maize being disappointing in yield ; but the opportunity must, or ought to,
                        be followed up with increased assiduity in order to make the business a
                        permanent one, remembering, also, that the population is constantly
                        increasing and that cereal growing is giving place to cotton, which pays
                        better. Besides that, the standard of living is rapidly being raised and new
                        towns and industries are being established, We may also remember another
                        thing Not long since one of the largest machinery orders ever given anywhere
                        was secured by an English firm of four milling engineers for a plant in
                        South America, and the mill will very soon beat work. Behind that again yet
                        another mill quite as large is to be built upon the most modern lines, to
                        make flour for export to Europe. In the Argentine « powerful syndicate has
                        come to the conclusion that it will be more profitable to export flour than
                        wheat, and before long it will be during it, so that we have one more reason
                        for exhorting the home miller to get farther afield before the crush comes,
                        to get established before the days of greater struggling begin to dawn’ It
                        is a comparatively easy task to hold the home fort in the top grades, but
                        the medium and the residue are both likely to get more troublesome every
                        year. ‘The British palate is a mighty particular one in these days, and
                        everything in flour below the top grade is unsuited to it, and we single out
                        Egypt and Scandinavia as typical countries where there ought to be a
                        sufficient outlet for that residue, given the grit and push which is
                        supposed to be characteristic of our mental and physical embodiment.</p>

                    <head>INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND IN ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <p>The Countess of Meath sends us the following communication : On various
                        occasions you have kindly promoted the cause of ® most useful institution
                        “The Industrial School for the Blind” in Alexandria. This establishment was
                        one of those fortunate enough to be allowed to show its wares at the
                        Agricultural Exhibition in Cairo opened this afternoon by H.H. the Khedive,
                        who graciously visited the stall allotted to the Blind School, and thus gave
                        Lord Meath, who was present, an opportunity to tell his Highness that it was
                        this institution which first introduced European wicker work into Egypt This
                        industry is now being taken up in several other establishments, and notably
                        in Egyptian prisons It is much to be hoped that criminal labour - though in
                        itself good for those engaged in it — will not be permitted to under sell
                        that done by honest hands, and thus spoil the market. Five pupils from the
                        Blind School at Alexandria were present, and it is gratifying to find what
                        skillful workmen they have become under the instruction of English teachers.
                        One of the former attracted a good deal of notice by the ease with which he
                        was reading and writing Traille type. This institution, unlike the
                        interesting one established at Zeitoun, has never accepted an Egyptian
                        Government grant, as it is the exclusive property of the Ministering
                        Childrens League, a society started in England for the purpose of training
                        children to lead unselfish lives and to take an active interest in the needs
                        of the poor and suffering. The Association has now the proud record of
                        having initiated the foundation of 17 buildings devoted to charity in
                        different parts of the world, Some of them are even found in distant
                        Australasia, as in all four quarters of the globe this society has its
                        branches. No less than 32 centres of work have been established lately in
                        Russia. The Blind School in Alexandria has during the 8 or 9 years of its
                        existence been fortunate enough to secure many friends bat, it needs still
                        more who will kindly assist the blind in the best way, namely, by helping
                        them to help themselves. A new teacher has lately come out from England, who
                        will keep a good stock of wares in band, and will also gladly take orders
                        for any special articles es to meet the needs of customers.</p>

                        fire. There was a large audience present, but they dispersed in an orderly
                        manner and there ‘was no stampede, The entire cinematograph apparatus and a
                        small portion of the Esperanza Hall were burnt out. The damage to the
                        machinery and films is estimated at from £300 te £900. The Alexandria Fire
                        Brigade, under Yoosbashi Waller, was very prompt in arriving on the scene
                        and within ten minutes of the call the fire was extinguished.</p>

                        increased, and there were by this time some three to four hundred people

                        animation with which the discussions of the many and various demands brought
                        forward was carried on. The Assembly debated all the morning until midday
                        and resumed its deliberations in the afternoon at: 8 o'clock and did not
                        adjourn until late in the evening. The resolutions proposing the enlargement
                        of Tantah railway station and that the estates of intestate Moslems should
                        be devoted to charitable purposes were passed without opposition. The
                        greatest interest was shown in the proposal that the Arabic language should
                        be the sole vehicle of instruction in all the Government schools, whether
                        primary, secondary, or superior. Siad Pasha Zaghloal strongly opposed this
                        measure is a most eloquent speech. He declared that neither the text books
                        nor the teaching staffs were available for the purpose and he deprecated the
                        resolution as premature and calculated to injore the cause of education in
                        Egypt if it were given effect to. In spite of his speech the resolution was
                        carried with only five dissentients. “The most important resolution next
                        discussed was that that full parliamentary institutions should be given to
                        the Egyptian people, who should have entire control of the financial and
                        other administrations. Pending the development of these institutions it was
                        demanded that the powers of the Legislative Council should be largely
                        increased. ‘This resolution was carried by a large majority. A member who
                        advocated the improvement and reform of the Wakfs Administration met with no
                        support. Another member, who proposed that free education should be

                    <p>THE EQYPTIAN COMMAND.</p>
                    <p>The following is the full text of Mr Haldane’s statement on the forthcoming
                        change in the Egyptian command. It is contained in the customary memorandum
                        of the Secretary of State for War, which accompanies the Army estimates of
                        effective and non-effective services, which were published a few days ago :
                        For many years the Commanders-in-Chief at Malta and Gibraltar have also been
                        charged with the responsibilities of the civil government of those Colonies;
                        and it has been necessary to provide a complete staff, general,
                        administrative, and personal, on a liberal scale at each station. At the
                        same time these two commands, as well as the third Mediterranean command of
                        Egypt, have been entirely independent of one another, with out any provision
                        for coordination except through the War Office itself. In view of the
                        progress made with decentralization from the War Office, it has been decided
                        to appoint a purely military Commander-in-Chief, with no civil duties, for
                        the Mediterranean as a whole, to be stationed at Mita. No increase in cost
                        of any kind will result from the new arrangements.</p>

                    <p>ALLEN. ALDERSON'S EXHIBITS.</p>
                    <p>The first stand on the right, on entering the show ground, is occupied by
                        Messr. Allen, Alderson and Company Limited, of Alexandria and Cairo, who
                        exhibit a considerable number of interesting engines and machines. The pair
                        of 20. H.P. ploughing engines, manufactured by Messrs. John Fowler &amp; Co.
                        (Leide) Ltd. with their implements are conspicuously placed in front of this
                        stand, needless to say they are beautifully finished and in every respect
                        among the leading articles in this line. We understand that Messrs, Allen,
                        Alderson and Company Limited had prepared three sets of tackle for this
                        show, but both the 12 H.P. and 16 H.P. set were sold a few days since and it
                        was impossible to spare them for the time necessary for the show. Alongside
                        these engines is one of Messrs. Ruston, Proctor and Co. Ltd. well known
                        Tibbin-making trashing machines in motion. Here again we understand other
                        machines possessing specially interesting features for Upper Egypt prepared
                        for the show, had to be delivered to buyers and were consequently lost for
                        exhibition purposes. We were informed that last year Messrs. Ruston, Proctor
                        and Co. Limited made and delivered 986 thrashing machines in all, a number
                        which we believe has never been beaten as the production of one firm in this
                        line. The various portable steam and oil engines exhibited on this stand
                        call for no special comment beyond tbe statement that they were all np to
                        the usual standard of the makers. We ware specially interested in the new
                        pattern helical pumps by Messrs. Ruston, Proctor and Co. Limited, of which
                        quite a number were on show. These pumps are evidently great favorites, as
                        we notice many of them on the stands of others makers being driven by
                        various motors, and the "Ecols des Artiet Metiers" have a beautifully
                        finished model of one of them on their stand. Messrs. Alien, Alderson and
                        Company Limited, also show a very interesting deep lift centrifugal pump for
                        wells 50 ft. deep, driven by a 5 H.P. oil engine. This was de designed for
                        Upper Egypt, where there are hundreds of wells on which a sakieh was
                        erected, irrigating about 5 to 6 feddans. The cattle plague stopped many of
                        these and this small pump and engine was prepared to take be place of the
                        sakiehs. It cannot fail to be a boon to the man of small means. The same may
                        be said of the 2. H.P. oil engine and 8 helical pump on the same stand,
                        which is a corresponding plant for Lower Egypt. We cannot conclude this
                        notice without alluding to the 40 g. H.P. as suction plant and engine on
                        this stand, this a beautiful piece of work, made by Ruston, Proctor and Co.
                        Limited, and we bear that Messrs. Allen, Alderson and Co. Limited have sold
                        a considerable number of these, all of which are giving the utmost
                        satisfaction, they are suitable for corn mills, centrifugal pumps, electric
                        lighting and the hundreds of oases where a moderate amount of power is
                        required, combined with the utmost economy. We were informed that the
                        Aboukir Co. Ltd. has lately installed two of these with centrifugal pumps,
                        on their estates near Ramleh, and were much pleased with them. Messrs.
                        Allen, Alderson and Co. Limited have had a special and long experience in
                        this line, as previous to Messrs Ruston, Proctor and Co. Limited taking up
                        the manufacture they erected a number of plants made by other continental
                        firms. We noticed a good show of Messrs F. Reddaway and Co. Ltd’s famous
                        “Camel” brand belting. This article has made its way all over the world and
                        we need add little beyond stating that here as elsewhere we were told it was
                        the belt of the future. In conclusion we may say that we were glad to see so
                        good a show from the oldest firm in the machinery line in Egypt, as there is
                        often too much of a disposition to rest on their laurels in long established
                        businesses. Messrs. Alter, Alderson and Co. Limited show however that they
                        mean to move with the ime, and if possible keep a little ahead of it. </p>

                    <p>This well known firm of world-wide reputation has exhibited a number of very
                        interesting specimens of railway material of every description. We
                        especially noticed a complete installation of light railway plant, in
                        connection with steel tipping, wagons drawn by a locomotive of 600 m/m
                        gauge, the working of which was much admired. Among other items of interest
                        our attention was called to light and heavy tails and sleepers of various
                        sections points, and crossing, turntables, wheels, and axes, axleboxes and
                        different types of platform and sugarcane wagons used on light railways. All
                        the trucks bearing the mark "Arthur Koppel” combining lightness with
                        strength and durability are of the latest design, fitted with special patent
                        roller bearings” which give a great saving of hauling power. We can
                        therefore highly recommend Messrs. Arthur Koppels’ plant to all cultivators,
                        industrials and contractors of this country, which will surely find this

                        o'clock tea to usher in the “Egyptian Standard” and “L'Etendard Egyptien”
                        took place at the Grand Continental Hotel, Cairo. All the ‘Egyptian

                        “Nationalist Party” were assembled in the Arabic Hall of the hotel, which

                        therefore to inform our readers that he again dilated with impassioned
                        eloquence on his great war cry of “Carthago eat delenda” aid after speaking
                        on this topic for a considerable time sat down amidst the enthusiastic
                        plaudits of his audience.</p>
                    <p>Next came the French editor of “L’Etenard Egyptien.”</p>
                    <p>M. Saint Ozan’s discourse: was embellished with some remarkable historical
                        allusions, We extract the following from the exordium:</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen: In the eighteenth century and under the ministry of Fleury France
                        remained inactive in presence of the Russian menace against Poland. Fired
                        with indignation, a Frenchman, the Count of Pélo, wished to rave his
                        country’s honor. He put himself at the head of a body of his compatriots and
                        without instructions of any kind, obeying simply a generous impulse,
                        endeavored to carry assistance to the beleaguered town of Dantzig.</p>
                    <p>I compare the group of Frenchmen who compose the editorial staff of L’Etenard
                        Egyptian with the above small army.</p>
                    <p>In his peroration he invokes the Hundred Years’ War:—</p>
                    <p>The cruel and undeserved ordeal of the English Occupation is only a short
                        episode in your long history. Egypt can be patient for she is eternal. Many
                        are the events which Have passed before the eyes of the crouching sphinx
                        lost in the meditation of its past.</p>
                    <p>At the risk of galling a wound that ever bleeds, I will venture to say that
                        when the ordeal to which I have referred is over. It will not have proved
                        injurious to Egypt. For it is from the rude contact with the foreigner that
                        nations rite to self-consciousness. In France the national sentiment dates
                        from the Hundred Years' War. We too have experienced an English Occupation
                        and it is thanks to it that we learnt we were Frenchmen. In the same way the
                        soul of the Egyptian Fatherland is gathering strength today from its efforts
                        to regenerate the country and prepare the way for the future when its head
                        will be reared to the height of its destiny.</p>
                    <p>Many among the audience failed to catch the similitude between the Hundred
                        Years’ War and the British Occupation, but it is considered that the French
                        Editor meant to darkly allude to the chance of Mme Juliette Adam becoming an
                        Egyptian Joan of Aro, At any rate, M. SantOgan’s speech was much applauded.
                        The next orator was the English Editor of “The Egyptian Standard” Mr.
                        Charles: Rudy, who together with Mr. Moloney, are to guide the tortunes of
                        the new paper under the Pasha’s direction.</p>
                    <p>We heed not give Mr. Rudy's speech in full. The following preliminary remarks
                        of that gentleman will suffice:—</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen.— It will necessary for me to explain to you Mr. Malorey’s and my
                        pressence among you here today, the reason why we have come to Cairo to work
                        under Moustafa Kamel Pasha’s guidance on the editorial staff of "The
                        Egyptian Standard."</p>
                    <p>Before our arrival we heard and read about the foreign autocratic government
                        which is endeavoring to throttle Egyptian independence. We learnt how it had
                        come to the Nile Valley to advise the Egyptian Government, to restore order
                        before leaving and to teach the people how to govern themselves. We had read
                        about treaties signed in the name of the British nation, and promises made
                        by statesmen in the name of the British nation. These treaties and promises
                        have proved to be empty, however; they were looked upon as worth as sheets
                        of papers and hollow word, involving the honour and dignity of no nation. We
                        were surprised, Mr. Manoley and I, at this disregard for given word. We
                        could not understand it. Surely statesmen and signatories —all of them
                        British— could bear their country no such ill-will as to cause her name to
                        be looked at askance abroad. For was not England ore of the bulwarks of
                        progress and civilization? Was she not a free nation? How could she then
                        tyrannize over a foreign people, a country which was neither a colony nor a
                        protectorate, but a friend? I repeat it, gentlemen, we could not understand
                        it! We were surprised to learn the ins and outs of certain happenings: in
                        the Nile Valley; some even disgusted us when the gold palm with which they
                        had been disguised wore off etc., etc.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. Rudy had finished the Pacha made another long speech and then a
                        tes, L‘ad anglaise” be it noted, wis served and success to the new papers
                        was drunk in tea.</p>
                    <p>The "Egyptian Standard” made its first appearance yesterdAy morning. It
                        contains. a number cf articles all written in the style, which the
                        anglophobe vernacular Press has made us acquainted with for years past with
                        the sole difference that English and not Arabic is the medium.</p>

                    <p>The final of the Big Unit Shield was played at Ghezireh on the 2nd inst.,
                        amidst great enthusiasm on the part of a very considerable crowd of
                        spectators. The teams left in being were the Coldstream Guards and the
                        Dublin Fusiliers. The latter team were the favourites, and by superior all
                        round play and better combination gained a well deserved victory by 8 goals
                        to 1. The game throughout was keen, and the football of a high standard, the
                        Dublins were quicker on the ball, their left forward being especially
                        conspicuous for pace and brilliant play. Lieut. Crozier also, outside left,
                        was very sound and safe. The first goal to the Dublins the Guard’s goal
                        keeper was caught napping, and the same may be said for the Dublins, when
                        the Guard, scored their one and only goal. The judgment displayed by the
                        Rev. Anderson as referee was highly commendable.</p>

                    <head>KHARTOUM AGRICULTURAL SHOW.”</head>
                    <p>The fifth Annual Agricultural and Industrial show of Khartoum Province was
                        held in the Public Gardens last week, under the patronage of His Excellency,
                        the Governor General. A large number of exhibits were displayed in the usual
                        manner. </p>

                    <p>In the morning, the exhibits were examined by the committee of judges, and
                        prizes were awarded. In the afternoon the gardens were opened to the public,
                        who came in large numbers. The weather was fine, and the music furnished by
                        the band of the King's Rifles: added considerably to the enjoyment of all
                        present. The Governor General and Lady Wingate visited the exhibition at
                        4.20 p.m. They were received at the entrance by Miralai Stanton Bey and the
                        Mamur of Khartoum. ' His Excellency was much pleased with the exhibition and
                        expressed his satisfaction to the Governor.</p>

                    <p>At 5 o'clock refreshments were served at the refreshment pavilion. The
                        Governor entertained those that contributed to the prize fund, to tea and
                        refreshments. His Excellency left the gardens at 6 p.m. after which prizes
                        in cash and in the shape of fancy silver articles, were distributed among
                        the successful exhibitors.</p>

                    <p>The success of the exhibition is in large measure due to the energy and
                        interest of Miralai Stanton Bey, the Governor of the Province, who was aided
                        by his able staff of officers and officials. On the whole, the exhibition
                        was decidedly in advance of that of last year. With the exception of the
                        silverware department, the industrial section did not make much advance. No
                        carpentry work was exhibited except a number of articles made at the Prison,
                        and, as we are told, not especially designed for the exhibition. The Gordon
                        College Workshops could certainly have sent a creditable exhibit of
                        carpentry work done by their pupils. The first prize for Angarebs was
                        awarded for an angareb of Zin wood, made in the shape of a European
                        bedstead, and carved in a rather bizarre fashion. Mesers. Dilavari exhibited
                        a fine collection of cement pavement. The agricultural section was certainly
                        in advance of former exhibitions. The cotton samples were of very fine
                        quality, much superior to anything hitherto seen. The vegetable collections
                        attracted much attention. There is no doubt but that market gardening would
                        be quite profitable in this country, if well taken in hand, and would supply
                        an important need. Very fine collection of grain of last year’s crop were
                        exhibited. On the whole, says the “Sudan Times” the improvement is quite
                        marked though the agricultural section indicates more of it than the
                        industrial. The evidence is clear that the Government is putting forth every
                        reasonable effort to develop the resources, of the country, and by such
                        exhibitions is encouraging Agriculture and Industry, and leading the country
                        forward to a grand destiny.</p>

                    <p>THE ELECTIONS. London, March 2.</p>
                    <p>The progressives claim support in to-day's election on the ground of past
                        services, also on the unique chance of effecting reforms offered by the
                        combination of the Liberal Government with the Progressive Council. Mr. John
                        Burns, who is not a candidate, in a manifesto describes the reformers
                        campaign as the most vulgar and disgraceful which ever discredited British
                        public life. He urges the electors to defeat the monopolists who are
                        endeavoring to make London their prey. The reformers claim that the defeat
                        of the progressives would be a serious blow to the Government. (Reuter)</p>
                    <p>London, March 3.</p>
                    <p>The County Council elections have resulted in a sweeping defeat for the
                        progressives, 79 moderates, or self-styled municipal reformers, and 89
                        progressives have been elected, aa compared with 85 moderates and 83
                        progressives in 1904. The progressives blame the socialists, for the loge of
                        the seats. A reformer won Mr. John Burns’ former seat at Baitersea.

                    <p>Mr, Winston Churchill, speaking at Oxford, said that the Government could not
                        abolish Chinese labour in South Africa without the consent of the South

                        pronounce their opinion, but whatever the decision would be the Government
                        would keep its pledges though it required time to carry them out.

                    <p>The “Nene Freie Presse" has interviewed
                        M. De Martens on the second Hague Conference.
                        He said that the main object of the
                        conference would be the formation of a commission
                        to hold an international enquiry. He did
                        not believe that the discussion on disarmament
                        would lead to practical results. (Havas)</p>
                    <p>LONDON, March 2.</p>
                    <p>Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman, in an article to
                        the new Liberal weekly paper "The Nation,”
                        says that he considers the objections to discussing
                        the limitation of armaments at the
                        Hague conference baseless, and points out
                        that the original conference was convened for
                        that object Great Britain has already shown
                        her sincerity by the reduction in the army and
                        navy. He is convinced that the world recognises
                        that the British naval preponderance is
                        non-aggressive. (Reuter)</p>
