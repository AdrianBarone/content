                    <p>A GOOD START IN LIFE.</p>
                    <p>Mothers should early realize how essential good health is for the success of
                        their child in after life. A badly nourished baby generally means an
                        undersized child, wanting in stamina and vigour If unable to nurse your baby
                        you must give the substitute that most closely resembles human milk. No
                        farinaceous or starchy food or unmodified cow's milk is permissible to a
                        child under 6 to 7 months of age The Allensburys Mak Foods are so prepared
                        as to remove the different in milk and Human milk, and they are as easy of

                    <p>Even the most optimistic supporter of the "Lady romer Dispensaries" hantly
                        expected that the growth and progress of these institutions would be a rapid
                        as has proved to be the anse Pounded about two years ago for the alleviation
                        of the sufferings of the ailing children of the poor, it sprang at once into
                        popularity, and each year bringe ever increasing numbers of patients for
                        treatment, and whereas the number which passed through in November 1906
                        renched only 15H7, quite four times that number were treated during the
                        corresponding month of last year Every little patient who is brought to the
                        dispensary must be accompanied by its mother or some responsible member of
                        its family in order that the treatment accorded it may be explained, and the
                        first principles of hundaging, hygiene etc taught. Thus the</p>
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>knowledge of elementary treatment necessary in case of sickness, accident or
                        disease, is being rapidly spread among the poorer inhabitants of Cairo, and
                        as it is undoubtedly due to the lack of this knowledge that the death rate
                        among infants and children in the town remains at such an alarmingly high
                        standard, it is impossible to over rate the importance of the institution
                        But the expenses attached to the undertaking are necessarily great, and are
                        ever increasing the number of patients multiply, we would therefore remind
                        our readers that though the subscriptions now exceed LE 5,000 there is still
                        an urgent need of fonds, and that subscriptions are cordially invited by the
                        committee appointed for the collection of money for this purpose. All the
                        banks and most of the large companies of Cairo have already subscribed
                        handsomely to the fand, but there are still countless public bodies and
                        private individuals who, probably from want of thought, have omitted to
                        place their names on the list of subscribers, and we feel sure that these
                        will need no further inducement to do so than the obvious good accomplished
                        by the undertaking ho too offer them. It will be remembered that on Lord
                        Cromer's departure large and influential committee representing all
                        interests and Nationalities was formed under the presidency of the Prime
                        Minister, and that after a great deal of discussion it was decided to raise
                        subscriptions in appreciation and memory of Lord Cromer's work in Egypt and
                        as Lord Cromer bad expressed his wish that this useful work of Lady Cromer
                        should be continued, it was decided that the subscriptions should be applied
                        to the development and extension of Lady Cromer's dispensaries. A
                        subcommittee was formed to collect foods and the Governor of the National
                        Bank of Egypt wm appointed honorary treasurer. All subscriptions and
                        enquiries should be therefore, ad dressed to the Governor of the National
                        Bank, Cairo, where any one interested will also be shewn the full list of
                        subscribers. We trust hat the support which this institution has already
                        received may be increased in a manner which will enable the promoters to
                        cope with the increasing demands upon their food Dot only will those who
                        subscribe to these funds be assisting one of the most far reaching schemes
                        of charity in the country, they are also contributing to a monument of Lord
                        Cromer's work.</p>

                        <head>BRITISH CONSULAR COURT</head>
                        <p>A Cairo contemporary in pursuance of its invariable policy of attacking
                            the methods of the English administration in Egypt has devoted two
                            columns of its valuable space without having even taken the trouble to
                            ascertain the truth of its allegations to the condemnation of an alleged
                            action of the British Consular court. Our contemporary informs us that
                            this amazing example of judicial irregularity is that the British
                            Consular Court has condemned the Badan Government to pay an indemnity of
                            LE 2,500 to Mr. Levy British national." The source from whence this
                            startling information springs renders denial almost unnecessary However
                            it is just possible that there may be persons among the general public
                            of Egypt gifted with a credulity equal to that of our contemporary, it
                            is perhaps as well to publish the truth of the matter. To begin with the
                            account of the affair quoted above is absolutely false, the facts of the
                            case being as follows. Differences having arisen between Mr. Levy,
                            gentlemen of Italian extraction, and the Sudan Authorities, it was
                            decided to refer the matter to arbitration, and Me Alban, the British
                            Consul in Cairo, wm mutually chosen to act us arbitrator. After
                            examination of the case his decision favoured Mr. Levy and he gave his
                            judgment accordingly, his decision being of course accepted a final and
                            binding by both the parties concerned. Mr. Alban is arbitrating this
                            matter was acting as an individual only, his position in relation to the
                            Consular Court having nothing whatever to do with the affair. It
                            happened that he was chosen as being possessed of knowledge which in
                            such case would enable him to treat the seatter on strictly just terms,
                            but it was Mr. Alban the person and not Mr. Alban of the British
                            Consulate wbo arbitrated, and had his position been that of sbop keeper,
                            or his name Smith, Jones or Mustapha, his finding would have carried
                            equal weight provided that he had been mata ally obosen to perform the
                            task of arbitration by the contesting parties. And to another bubble has
                            burst and credit for yet another ingenious invention must be accorded to
                            our imaginative contemporary </p>

                        admitted that the material con Hition of the people hat nhatantially
                        improved under the British, but this should have been accompanied by a

                    <p>Sir E Grey made a fine speech defending the British officials, pointing out

                        agricultural value for the experimental stages of the work undertaken by the
                        Corporation of Western Egypt both regards land development and water supply
                        can now be said to have concluded, and the real work to have begun Porty wo
                        borrms have been drilled up to the present time, and without exception the
                        results have fully justified the expectations of the promoters of this great
                        enterprise, for an average yield of about seventy five gallons of water per
                        minute has been obtained and the maximum delivery has reached four hundred
                        gallons per minute for one bore. The natural prodnots of the Onsis can also
                        be taken as a very fair criterion of what may be expected when the land has
                        been traster, for there are in Kharga some 60,000 date, and other fruit
                        trees, all of them bearing fruit equal to the very best samples which have
                        been obtained in any part of Paypt and the Corporation has already planted
                        some 14,000 of various kinds. Cotton, barley and other crops have already

                    <head>WR WARSICK'S CONCERT </head>
                    <p>The contine concert given by Mr. Marsick at the Khedival Hotel yesterday
                        attracted large and fashionable audience, which must have been very
                        gratifying to that talented violinist. From wbat we heard yesterday we have
                        no hesitation in saying that Mr. Marsick is a perfect master of his
                        instrument. His style reminded us ocasionally somewhat of Romanzi, and his
                        delicate handling of the several items contributed was very highly
                        appreciated He was perhaps heart at bis best in a sobata by Cesar Pranks
                        which was admirably played. Mr. Marnick has a most valuable ally in Mlle
                        Panlette Demeri who contributed two pianoforte solo executed in</p>
                    <p>manner rarely heard in Alexandria. By the keen perception of light and shade,
                        coupled with depth of feeling which characterised ber entire performance
                        Mlle Demeri proved berself musician of very high order. The solos played
                        were not mentioned on the programme, but we think they were by Chopin. The
                        other numbers were contributed by Mlle D'Espiney who has a soprano voice of
                        good timbre aod sang in exoelleut taste, and in some instances very
                        daintily, several songs by well known composers among the best of which were
                        the "Air de la Naiade d'Armide by Glook, and "Villanello" by Berlion, which
                        were exceedingly well rendered.</p>

                        <p>SIR E GREY'S REPLY</p>
                        <p>LAND, February 1 House of Commons. Mr. Robertson move</p>
                        <p>Amendment to the Address urging consti tational reform in Egypt. While
                            Lord Cromer's administration, he said, benefitted the Egyp tians
                            materially it was marrel by mistakes and did not promote moral
                            development. Sir &amp; Grey deprecated the constant imputation that the
                            officials in Egypt were invanably wrong, otherwise bo sell respecting
                            man would enter the service. The part government of Egypt bad crushed
                            out from the race all the qualities essential to self goverument and the
                            people had not yet soquired them. If the principles of self-government
                            were applied too rapidly the result would be corruption, con fusion,
                            disorder, and oppression. Sir Eldon Gorst has fully justified the
                            anticipation that be would realise the hopes shared by Lond Cromer and
                            the Government when he was appointed</p>

                            representative institutions must be slow. In the meanwhile, the Imperial
                            Government will use ita inftrance to ensure the government, though

                            alludes to the Emperor Hadriani's opinion of the Alexandris of his day

                            ignorance of the facts of the case, and not taking the trouble to
                            enquire I wrote a personal account of the wreck and the perilous
                            position of the crew and commented strongly, but nothing like a I felt,

                            ignorant I now say it never ought to have been allowed to drop, and it
                            is high time the subject was brought up again strongly, and not left
                            until carried right through. There is more money wasted on unnecessary
                            expenditure, and other things than would purchase anil endow several

                            entirely maintained by voluntary contributions I am proud of the fact
                            But were it not so, I am certain that steps would have been taken long
                            ere this, for a similar service, either by the State, or some public
                            body. We cannot, perhaps, compare Egypt with Great Britain, but the
                            argument that because the public will not come forward and provide the
                            funds for such an institution, nothing should be done and no one is
                            responsible, can hardly be sound Sne one is responsible, I way it
                            emphatically. morally, if not legally and as we English have undertaken
                            the task of shewing Egypt how to run herself on English lines na ATA

                            Departments it is at all unreasonable for me to cast the responsibility
                            of this great want being still unsatisfied on the shoulders of a fellow
