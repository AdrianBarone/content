                    <p>PRESS IN WAR TIME </p>
                    <p>The question of the Press in time of war has now passed into its penultimate
                        stage.The Prime Minister has taken it under his official wing and, lhas
                        placed it upon the list of Government measures with which he hopes to deal
                        next year. That is a decision (says the "Morning Post") upon which both the
                        Press and the Government are to be congratulated the Press for voluntarily
                        raising the question and in a sense asking to be restrained generally where
                        restraint is essential to the national interest and the Government for
                        taking the matter up in a straightforward and effective fashion. Mr. Arthur
                        Lee, who as an ex Army officer, our Military Attache at Washington during
                        the Spanish American War, and a Civil Lord of the Admiralty under the late
                        Government, probably knows the ins and outs of the subject as well as any
                        man in the House recently asked the Prime Minister whether his attention had
                        been called to the recent conference of newspaper proprietors and editors,
                        "at which there was a unanimous expression of opinion in favor of
                        restricting or controlling the dissemination of news in time of war,” and
                        what action he proposed to take in consequence. The Prime Minister answered
                        that the matter was being considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence
                        and that he hoped to bring in a Bill dealing with it early next year. Mr.
                        Lee very properly asked whether the Bill might not be introduced this
                        session so that the Press might have an opportunity of studying its
                        provisions at leisure. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman replied that there were
                        means of communicating with the Press other than by introducing a Bill in
                        the House. We take this to me that nothing in the way of hasty legislation
                        is contemplated sad that the Press will either be consulted during the
                        period of drafting the Bill or that the Bill when completed will be referred
                        to the Press for criticism and suggestions. In either case the Government is
                        plainly prepared to collaborate with the Press in the work of formulating a
                        measures that will secure the maximum of safety to the State with the
                        minimum of interference with legitimate journalistic activities. It was for
                        this purpose that the Conference of June 21 authorised the Sub-Committee of
                        the Newspaper Society to add to its numbers men with special knowledge of
                        the points at issue and to consider any Bill that might be drafted. The
                        Government need not hesitate to treat the enlarged Sub-Committee as fully
                        representative of the Press as a whole. We would suggest that the right
                        course to take is for the Government to draft the sort of Bill it would like
                        to passed, and for the Sub Committee of the Newspaper society to bring its
                        provisions as far as possible into harmony with the opinions expressed at
                        the recent conference, and, if necessary to call a further conference. The
                        resultant would probably be a measure prohibiting in time of war and when
                        war is imminent the unauthorized publications as news of naval and military
                        movements. If there were incorporated in such a measure the guarantee which
                        the Committee of Imperial Defence but already informally offered-guarantee,
                        for instances that it would only be invoked in the event of an imminent war
                        with a first class Power, that it would come to operate automatically on the
                        conclusion of peace, and that its administration would be in civil hands-the
                        Press would, we believe, be found ready to accept it. In the long run the
                        three interests of journalism and the true interests of the nation must be
                        identical. The Press cannot gain where the nation loses, and that the nation
                        s tands to lose heavily by the unrestricted publication of news in time of
                        war is very evident. Journalists desire to relieve their profession from its
                        liability to become at any moment a source of peril to the country.</p>

                        <p>A terrible story is published by a Cairo contemporary which shows that
                            Egypt can boast some imported savages in every way equal to the
                            Manoufiah product. It is stated that a Greek servant girl who had been
                            employed for several years at the house of one Ch. Callicopoulo, a Cairo
                            bootmaker, was recently accused by her master of the theft of money and
                            jewels. To extort a confession her scoundrelly employer beat the girl
                            most cruelly, kicked her, poured boiling oil over her hands and wrists,
                            and finally tied her up and tortured her by applying boiling eggs to the
                            armpits! These last tortures inflicted such excruciating pain that the
                            poor girl died of the shock. The Greek Consulate has ordered Dr. Lambros
                            to enquire into the affair and has refused to listen to certain medical
                            evidence obtained by Callicopoulo, who will be tried here before M.
                            Scotidie. We are informed by the Greek Consulate that the name of the
                            victim is Dandris. She died after three days of agony. A warrant has
                            been issued for the arrest of Callicopoulo, who will be tried at the
                            Criminal Assinas at Alexandria in December. M. Vernitki Hellenic, Vice
                            Colonel, is investigating the case. The sum alleged to have been stolen
                            is 300 pounds, and it is said that the loss of it turned the brain of
                            Callicopoulos, who is well known among the Hellenic colony of Cairo. </p>

                        <div type="item"><p>Those who are best able to judge Egypt's needs as a result of many years' experience of the
                                country strongly deprecate the remarks which have been made by
                                certain irresponsible individuals in the House of Commons during the
                                last few days in connection with the verdict in the Danishwi affair.
                                The utterances are looked upon as mere Little Englandiam and as
                                having the savour of a desire for self-notoriety. </p>
                            <p>It is sincerely hoped by all who have the real welfare of Egypt at
                                heart that the public at home will not be led away by the excessive
                                deal of persons who are simply desirous of making political capital
                                out of this unfortunate incident. </p>
                            <p>As an instance of how little the customs of the country are
                                understood here, the wailing of the women at the time of the
                                execution has been made much of and has produced a great effect on
                                the feelings of individuals who are unaware that it is the custom
                                for this to occur in all cases of death, and had no other
                                significance at Denishwai. </p>
                            <p>I learn that the action of the Egyptian authorities has met with the
                                entire approval of both the Europeans and the educated natives as
                                being absolutely necessary to check any undue lawlessness and
                                brutality on the part of the lower class of natives, who are not yet
                                sufficiently advanced in the path of civilisation to appreciate
                                unjust leniency. </p>
                            <p>It is considered to be most unlikely that the home Government will
                                interfere in the matter. </p></div>

                    <div type="item"><p>In the House of Commons last Wednesday, Mr. Dillon asked the Prime Minister, in the absence of
                            the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether he had been made
                            aware of the fact that that morning four Egyptians were sentenced to
                            death by the special court in connexion with the unfortunate affair at
                            Denishwai, and whether he could undertake to obtain a respite of the
                            sentence until the Foreign Minister had had an opportunity of personally
                            examining the evidence given betro the tribunal. </p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister: I have not heard anything of the circumstance
                            referred to by the hon. member, but I am sure we can trust to the
                            discretion and humanity of my right hon. friend the Foreign Secretary
                            (Sir Edward Grey) to see that everything is done that may be necessary.
                            (Cheers.) </p>
                        <p>On the following day, Mr. Dillon asked the Secretary of State for Foreign
                            Affairs, whether he had yet received any detailed information as to the
                            aircumstarces which led to the affray: whether any of the natives were
                            killed or injured; if any natives were killed or injured, would the
                            British officers who took part in the affray be tried; whether the
                            pigeons shot on these occasions were tame or wild pigeons ; whether
                            occasions were tame or wild pigeons ; whether pigeon shooting in the
                            neighbourhood of villages was a legal occupation in Egypt; whether in
                            this instance the permission of the headman of the village had been
                            obtained by the officers before they commenced to shoot ; what were the
                            special grounds on which the Agent and Consul of Great Britain demanded
                            that the accused Egyptians in this case should be sent for trial before
                            the Special Tribunal; and whether there was any appeal from the Special
                            Tribunal before which the Egyptians were to be tried. </p>
                        <p>Sir E. Grey.--I cannot answer all the details of the hon. member's
                            question. I do not know whether any native was killed or injured, but
                            our information is that the British officers, when they were attacked by
                            the natives, gave up their guns and refused to fire in self-defence
                            (hear, hear), and if any natives were killed, it was clearly not by the
                            action of the British officers. When the report appeared in the Press
                            yesterday, I telegraphed to know what the sentences were, and what were
                            the facts established at the trial, saying that it was desirable we
                            should know them before any death sentences were executed. The
                            information I have received is as follows -The sentences were as stated
                            in the Press, except that, I think, only two men were sentenced to penal
                            servitude for life, whereas the Press stated four. With regard to the
                            trial, the prisoners were defended by three of the best-known native
                            advocates, who had a full hearing. The Court was unanimous as regards
                            the prisoners found guilty, and the evidence clearly established
                            premeditation and concerted actions. Thirty one of the prisoners were
                            acquitted and 21 were found guilty. The Court expressed its opinion that
                            the British officers had behaved with extreme forbearance and
                            self-restraint. (Hcar, hear.) The chief attack took place after they had
                            given up their guns and was persisted in with great brutality. I am also
                            informed that, in the opinion of Judge Bond and Mr. Hayter, the Acting
                            Judicial Adviser, both members of the Court, the first six prisoners
                            would undoubtedly have been found guilty of murder by a British jury.
                            The Special Court was composed of the Egyptian Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, who has had several years' experience in the Ministry of
                            Justice in the absence of the latter ; Mr. Bond, Vice-President of the
                            Native Court of Appeal, whose position is practically that of Dord Chief
                            Justice ; Fethy Bey, President of the Cairo Native Court; Mr. Hayter,
                            Action Judicial Adviser, formerly a Judge in the Sudan, and Colonel
                            Ludlew, Officiating Judge Advocate. </p></div>
