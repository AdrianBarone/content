                    <p>It is vain to dogmatise on the signs of <lb/>revolution. With different nations
                        revolution <lb/>will accomplish itself in different ways. In <lb/>France
                        is seen a fiery, frantic outburt, pro-<lb/>ducing horrors that leave an 
                        indelible mark on <lb/>the imaginations of men, England changes the <lb/>
                        ruling dyansty from Stuart to Hanover with <lb/>the calm matter-of-factness
                        which it displays <lb/>in the ordinary affairs of life. Neither affords <lb/>
                        any criterion from which to judge the prob- <lb/>abilities in Russia. Whether
                        or not revvolut-<lb/>tion is brewing there, who shall decide. Only <lb/>he who
                        possesses infallible knowledge of the <lb/>Russian character. And where shall
                        such a <lb/>man be found?</p>
                    <p>Without pretending to find portent in St. <lb/>Petersburg, says the "Evening
                        standard and <lb/>St. James's Gazette," we would draw attetion <lb/>to the
                        strange state of feeling there. Assassina-<lb/>tion has followed
                        assassination. The Terrorists <lb/>are said to have drawn up a list of
                        prominent <lb/>adminstrators whom they have condemned to <lb/>death, and on
                        that list are working with <lb/>deliberate determination. The first three
                        <lb/>names have been crossed out. Theri owners <lb/>have fallen to the
                        murderers revolver. The <lb/>
                        <!-- MINI COLUMN BREAK --> fourth name is that of Admiral Dubassoff,
                        <lb/>whose fate yet hangs in the balance. now, this <lb/>list made or may
                        not exit, but there is so firm a <lb/>belief in it that the threatened men
                        have come <lb/>to regard themselves as actually doomed. The <lb/>City
                        Perfect, having received a letter warning <lb/>him that he would be killed
                        on such and such <lb/>a day, felt that his hour had come, and on the
                        <lb/>fatal morning, says the "Telegraph" corres-<lb/>pondent with the
                        authority of a member of <lb/>the family, when setting out for the
                        inagura-<lb/>tion of the new church, he kissed his children
                        with<lb/>unwanted tenderness and blessed them with <lb/>great fervour.
                        General Pavloff, having reason <lb/>to think thathe was on the list, never
                        ventured <lb/> out of his house on foot, aking exercise in a <lb/>little
                        garden of a few square feet. Admiral <lb/>Dubassof declines to take these
                        precautions. <lb/>He walks abroad as uaul, faicng danger in the <lb/>open --
                        perhaps in the Oriental faith, strength-<lb/>ened by the fate of Pavloff,
                        that if death is to <lb/>come it will not be barred by walls and drawn
                        <lb/>swords. The other day the report was spread <lb/>that he has been
                        assassinated, and was <lb/>instantly accepted. Everybody is prepared for
                        <lb/>it. Attention seems to have been diverted for the<lb/> oment from all
                        others and to have concentraed on the Admiral.</p>
                    <p>An appaling state of things. This cold-<lb/>blooded advertisement of the next vistim,
                        and <lb/>the public confidence that the sacrifice will be <lb/>made, strikes one
                        as infinitely more horrible <lb/>than mob passion venting itself in tumult and 
                        <lb/>blood. The assassinations cause no surpise. <lb/>When they are reported the people
                        accepted them <lb/>philopsophically. We fancy we hear them <lb/>mururing "kismet" and see
                        them bowing <lb/>their heads not before the will of God but <lb/>before the will
                        of the Terrorists. The idea <lb/>Fate has possesses them and the so called <lb/>guardians of order
                        so completely that few <lb/>and feeble attempts are put forth to stay <lb/>the hand of 
                        the avenger. Openly threatned <lb/>as the Prefect was, the police took no effec-<lb/>
                        tive precautions to defend him. The assasin <lb/>of Pavloff gained admittance to the 
                        house on <lb/>the flimsiest of pretexts to take a hotliday abroad. The <lb/>brave ones
                        who remain adopt the attitude of <lb/>stories rather than that of strong men strug-<lb/>
                        gling against adversity. All that is ventured <lb/>is to hand the murdered who has done
                        his work, <lb/>and wait for an opportnity of handing the <lb/>next.</p>
                    <p>Ordinary, undistinguished, unthreatened, <lb/>people do not talk of the progress of the
                        Terror<lb/>as they walk around the streets. It is not safe <lb/>to do so. For long it has not been
                        safe to talk<lb/>in Russia. Yet we hear of the "notorous<lb/>sympathy of the public 
                        with the criminals". <lb/>We have besides that general statements that <lb/>atual words, declared to 
                        be characteristic of <lb/>the feeling of a great class, of the mother of<lb/>Ignsteiff's assassin
                        -- a prosperious, educated <lb/>woman. "Don't think, darling," she said to <lb/>her son, "that
                        I am going to reproach you. <lb/>On the contrary, I have nothing but priase for <lb/>your action.
                        You behaved as a true Christian. <lb/>You have bibly laid down your life for your <lb/>racing
                        through the streets tongues did begin <lb/>to wag. What they uttered was not horror of <lb/>
                    the murder, but approbation of the murderer. </p>
                    <p>When things come to this pass in a great <lb/>city its superficial calm - that is to say, its
                        <lb/>freedom from violent general upheaval such <lb/>as is suppored the precursor of
                        revolution - is <lb/>no matter for congratulation but cause for <lb/>anxiety graver than
                        than created by the <lb/>outbreaks of a few peasants ina re mote corner <lb/>of the land. 
                        It made be said that if St. Peters-<lb/>burg is ill disposed the rest of the country <lb/>
                        will be hard to rouse. Revolutions, howvwer, <lb/>are often manufactured and carried
                        through <lb/>in a capital, and the nation follows the capital, <lb/>raityfing its decision. Whether
                        revolution <lb/>be brooding over St. Petersburg we cannot <lb/>satisfy ourselves, nor can
                        anybody satisfy us. <lb/>But the silence of Russia - the terrible malig-<lb/>nant, 
                        mysterious silence - is more ominous <lb/>than the uprour of Bloody Sunday.</p>

                    <p>The total amount of specie imported into Egypt during the past year amounted
                        to LB 9,077,402, as against L.B. 4,782,215 in 1905. These figures show that
                        specie arrived here last year to the value of LE 4,295,187 more than in
                        1905, an increase of over four and a quarter millions in twelve months.
                        These figures are more significant when it is considered that the total
                        exports of specie from Egypt last year only amounted to LE 2,067,706, as

                        of LE. 1,802,233. In other words, Egypt received over four and a qqarter
                        millions more gold last year than in the year before and exported nearly two

                    <p>The total specie received from England in 1906 amounted to L.E. 5,949,720 in

                        477,907. The specie exported to Eogland was very small, only reaching total
                        of L.B. 569,124, or L.B. 1,282,988 le=8 than in 1905, when this country sent
                        LB. 1,852.112 to England. </p>
                    <p>In 1905 India sent specie to Egypt to the value of L.E. 1,462,509, botdid not

                        amonpted to L.R. 120,907, as against L.B. 1,442,941 in 1905. </p>
                    <p>Turkey sent gold to the value of L.B. 1,451,443 in 1966, an increase of L.E.
                        795,159 in 1905. Egypt's exports of gold to Turkey amounted to L.B. 907,504,
                        an increase of LR. 355,396 on 1905. </p>
                    <p>Specie to the value of L.B. 1,099,632 was received from France, an increase
                        of L.E. 810,*95 on the figures for the previous year.. | The figures for the
                        other countries are all under half a million. </p>

                    <p>The total number of English sovereigns which arrived in Egypt last December
                        from England was of the value of L.B. 982,220. Engli-h sovereigns were
                        imported from the following countries during December in the proportions
                        given: Torkey, L.E. 287,071; Prance, L.E. 152 100; Austria, L.E. 25,477 ;

                    <p>The annual ordinary meeting of the Egyptian Cotton Mille will be held in
                        London to-day, in order to receive and pass the stooopts for the financial
                        year ended on the 30th September, 1906. We have received the report of the
                        directors, and on looking through the accounts we remark that the results of
                        the year's work. ing are far from being satisfactory, sbowing, as they do, a
                        loss of £930, which, added to that acogmulated op to now and amounting to |
                        £19,738, makes a total loss of £20,668, which is equal to more than
                        one-eighth of the capital of the company. The Profit and Loss account shows
                        the following figures on the 30th Sep tember 1906: </p>

                    <p>It does not seem permissible that such heavy expenses as those of the Loodon
                        board of the company sbould be maintained, when the actual situation of the
                        company is 80 unsatisfactory and jastifies no management other than that of
                        the local board. On the other hand, interest paid to the banks on debit
                        balances and on mortgage loans seems to us to fetter heavily the improvement
                        of the future prospects of the company, whose industrial receipts do not
                        exceed £9,500 per annom. </p>

                        administrative expenses, it wonld perhaps be possible for it to gradually
                        liquidate its debts, as well as its losses. The balance sheet of the ocmpany

                    <p>MORE PRESS COMMENTS.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Robertson's visit continues to aronse considerable interest in the local
                        Press. His recent peregrinations in the provincer have especially attracted
                        the attention of the native and foreign newspapers, and any and various
                        comments are being passed on the visit of the Radical Member for the
                        Tyneside division of Northumberland to the scene of the tragedy of
                        Depishwai. </p>
                    <p>"Al Zaber," a Moslem daily newspaper of Cairo, pablisbes a leading article on
                        Mr, Robertson to the following effect :-Mr. J. M. Robertson, M.P, who after
                        the Denishwai affair gave vent to some severe criticisms in the House of
                        Commons upon the jadgment passed by the specially constituted coort in that
                        case, is, an enthusiaetio Liberal and recently came to Egypt on a vieit.
                        Here he was met by some enthusiastio members of the Nationalist Party, who
                        labour ander the impression that he entirely sbares their political views.
                        Bat the truth is that there is no real | accord between Mr. Robertson and
                        them, except that both are zeslots. Mr. Robertson is a member of a British
                        political party, the members of which believe that their policy is based on
                        right principles and should be followed in the interests of their pation.
                        Can any of our zealous Nationalists bring forward evidence to prove that
                        their policy is based on similarly bigbminded aims ? When Mr. Robert on
                        arrived in Cairo people went to greet him and exposed to him their opinions.
                        Various were the romours broited abroad as to the objects of his visit and
                        doubtless he is qnite ignorant of many of these reports. Many natives who
                        have heard all abçat Mr. R sbertson's visit to the natives of Depishwai are
                        now led thereby to believe in the emancipation of Egypt through his
                        instrumentality, but if they had read what was published io the "Times" they
                        would not be so bopeful. This gentleman is really among the strongest
                        supporters of Eng. lisb poliay in Egypt, for all Englishmen desire to see
                        their Egyptian policy to be firmly establisbed, and because some of them
                        want to see whether there is anything to criticise in it, their action is
                        merely due to a desire to improve their country's policy here. Under such
                        circumstances therefore it is sheer nonsense to expect that some of the
                        Erglish will help the Egyptians to get rid of the Occupation. Under the
                        circomstances all that can be done is to co-operate with the English by
                        coming to a good understanding with them in matters which can benefit Egypt
                        hereafter. The overwhelming po ioy some of us Egyptians adopt will only
                        produce the worst effects as we have already seen in some cases. We hope
                        that Mr. Robertson's personal intercourse with some of the Nationalists will
                        lead to these persons moderating their views and teach tbem to act in a
                        befitting manner so that they may not mislead the whole nation. </p>
