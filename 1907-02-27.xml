                            appreciative andience. Mr. Gairdner devoted bis attention to Wagner as a

                            while his later works were of ar entirely d ff-rent character—free
                            melodies with no soggestion of metre nor words, with bat little

                            recitative. Mr. Gairiper very clearly illustrated the metrical tendency
                            of this early period, showing from exsmples taken fiom ‘'l'anubauser’
                            that the lyrics grouped them-elves almost jnvefiably into quatrain form,
                            which arrangement was almost av obcession cf be day aid which often

                        <p>To rue Editor or tHe “Egyptian Gazettes’ </p>
                        <p>Sir,—I shonld like to make some remarks iv voor colamas oa the above
                            subject, which ems of interest both te visitors and to those whose
                            welfare is involved in maintaining the oopalarity of this city as a
                            place of resort. Dividing these remarks onder sanitation, traffic, and
                            mendicity, </p>
                        <p>Firstly —Why is it considered necessary to varge the various
                            templesdedicated to C nacina st 10 o'elock on a Sanday morning, which
                            also appears to be the day and hoor fixed for shaking carpets, etc, ont
                            of apper windows? Furthermore, coald not the aathorities orn cerned
                            arrange to cleanse the varions street refase-bins béfere these
                            receptacles become aa abomination? </p>
                        <p>Secondly as to trafic. The Sharia Gainena has been “ap” ever since
                            Ootober, asphalte is beiog laid down, and this sf cted street has in
                            rotation presented to the public a sketchy impression of the Bernese
                            Alps, a fair coarse for an obstacle race, and an spirited representation
                            of the destraction of the Cities of the Plain. This street is also a
                            kind of cyclonic centre for dranken brawls, the gentle fe tah treqnents
                            an Armenian liqnor den jast off the main strest, qnarrela in his caps
                            over the favoars of one or more of the attendant Hebee, and goes out
                            into the street t fight it oat with moch beilowing and thrashing of the
                            air with sticks. After the whole neighbourhood has been aroused a
                            shawish comes ap and appeals to the principal villaiti as a man ania
                            brother to go home. This attifude is dae to inadeqrate available force
                            and not t» fank, for I bave seen an Ezyptian policeman make 4 mst
                            dptorained arrest of an intoxicated Bey whose friends stragg ed
                            desperately to eff wt a rescue while the crowd all sympathised or
                            covertly impeded the arrest. However, the policeman kept his temper and
                            his man, and withoat drawing his tranchaon evantaally marched his
                            bey--hip off to the oaracol. </p>
                        <p>Before leaving tha police, it might be askad why they do not, whon
                            issaing licenses to arbaghie, insist on some test of driving and
                            topography. Tha local Jeha has no ides of eithar, aod having also no
                            “haols,” plies the whip savagsly and casselassly to cover his defects
                            (printer p'esse note that thie is not a paradox). Accidente would be
                            more treqaent if the horses were not anderfed | and the pace slow. He is
                            however a sports- man in his way, and his chief recreation con- sists in
                            endeavoaring to “ran down” wall- dressed Europeans. dast according to
                            local atmos; heriowgndition®, or, if be bas a clear street before him
                            and the khawagah does not look like a “sprinter,” he , can slash bim
                            over the face with his whip. It is a safe amusement, too, for most
                            Earopeans | koow better than take the case op. A month ago an arbaghi
                            came op behind me along the Sharia Kamel and with the whole road to
                            epare hagged the right side and withoot a word of , warniog | felt his
                            off horse's shoulder cannon | into mine ; he had plenty"of space bat
                            having some experience in “riding off” I got olear of his boofs and the
                            wheels, bat still it was not a bad attempt. Io that same street shortly
                            after, a friend of mine—an E iglishmin—had mach the same experience. He
                            pat ap his hands instinctively to ward off the impact, and the driver
                            slashed at him viciously with his whip as he passed. Stang and
                            indig»ant, my friend gave chase to get the man’s uamber. The , vehicle
                            tarned ap a side street and stopped. Finding no ommber on th@oarriags
                            (it was after- | wards foand te belong to one of the hotels) ha |
                            accosted the arbaghbi aod on the lat‘er refosing to give any account of
                            himself proceeded to arrest him. There was a scofiis and the Boglishman
                            was dropped with a deftly-fling | stone on the temple. Being real grit
                            he picked himself up, closad with his man, and he'd him till a policeman
                            came ap, nor did be inflict any further violence on the man afcer appre-
                            hending him. He, however, had no evidence , while the very horses were,
                            believe, prepared to give testimooy on tha o-her side, also the
                            policeman, whom my frisad hai omittei to win over. the arbaghi for
                            assanit and fired £5 and £3  ee the able-bodied cripple—with or without
                            oso- motive applianees—and worse, far worse than all, — the starving,
                            maimed, aad soffering children with parente—or other adalts in that
                            guise — watehing them from some point of vantage. </p>
                        <!--did not copy the middle of the article-->
                        <p>There is now on the streets of Cairo a tall, fine-looking fellah about
                            thirty years of age, who leads by the hand an emaciated, filthy little
                            girl, a mere child of five or so. She has hor feet tarned iow srds and
                            her legs are too weak to sapport her body for aey distance. "he man
                            come; toa oafé or open bar, gives thechild a paxh andin she staggers,
                            falls on har kanes, with her contorted limbs doubled ander her, and
                            whines shrilly. When she comes out the man takes what she has ia cash,
                            throws aay food away that she may have reosived, and drags her along to
                            the next likely resort. If the couple meet a respeoctably dressed
                            pedestrian moving slowly along some more or less deserted street the
                            same process is gone throagh with the same resalt. 1 have given the
                            aofortuoat: child money, and food, as many others do, bat I determioed
                            to watch the procesdiags, with the above resalt. The man I have often
                            seea withoat his stock-in- trade, the centre of « large and garralous
                            throng at one of the lower-class cafés and, apparently, at once the host
                            and eatertainer of the party. Faugh!! It isenoogh to make a bysena sick
                            to think of it. </p>
                        <p>Is there no remedy ! Is this inoflax of meodicants in the tourist season
