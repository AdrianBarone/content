                    <p>Berths can be definitely engaged beforehand. Plans can be seen at the Offices
                        of the Company’s Agents.</p>
                    <p>The through Steamers for Marseilles, Gibraltar, Plymouth and London are
                        Intended to leave Port Said after the arrival of the 11 a.m. train from
                        Cairo, every Monday. A steam tender will meet the train to convey passengers
                        to the ship.</p>
                    <p>The Brindisi Express Steamer leaves Port Said directly the Indian Mails
                        arrive. Passengers can go on board the evening before.</p>
                    <p>The express steamer usually reaches Brindisi on Wednesday afternoon, the
                        special train starting at 8 p.m. and arriving in London at the very
                        convenient hour of 4.56 p.m. on Friday.</p>
                    <p>The combined Sea and special train fare is £22.9.11 Port Said to London via
                        Brindisi or via Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>Passengers having paid fall fare in one direction are allowed an abatement of
                        25 per cent, on returning within 12 months.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the above regular weekly service there are sailings about
                        twice a fortnight of 5,000 to 7,000 tons steamers to London, calling at
                        Malta or Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>TO THE EAST.</p>
                    <p>The Mail Steamers leave Suez for Aden and Bombay every Wednesday, and for
                        Australia and China every alternate Wednesday. A steamer leaves for
                        Calcutta, fortnightly, and another for Japan. Passengers can embark at Port
                        Said.</p>

                        <p>The weather in the early part of yesterday was bright and cheerful, but
                            as the day advanced ominous clouds gathered and the atmosphere became
                            strongly charged with electricity. There was considerable loghtning and
                            thunder about 9 p.m., and this was followed by a moderate gale from the
                            W. The morning opens cool, cloudy, and dull, with squalls from the W.
                            and a falling barometer.</p>

                    <p>THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 15., 1906. MOROCCO CONFERENCE. It is almost a traiem to
                        say that the solemn conolavə which is being held at Algeciras involves
                        interests far wider than those of a semi-barbarian people in the north west
                        corner of Africa. Roughly speaking, the Conference will decide whether the
                        nations of Europe are determined to live in peace with out another or
                        whether they are still a lot of squabbling children, ready to take offence
                        at the first word spoken in a moment of anger. The responsible men of the
                        countries most interested have openly declared that they wait nothing so
                        much as peace. Bat the crucial question is now being discussed by the
                        delegates, and by their fraita we shall know tham. Germany has deliberately
                        thrust the policing question into the forefront of the controversy.. It she
                        had oontouted herself with her woonomio / claims her positioa would have
                        been onassail able. By the Madrid Treaty of 1880 she is entitled to equal
                        commercial treatment and the open door. Rugland, for bør own purpo:es,
                        limited her demands for equal treatment to a period of thirty years. But she
                        could not, of course, bind Germany by any private arrangement made' between
                        herselt. and France ; therefore Germany was perfeotly justified in taking
                        steps to make it known that there was to be no limitation of time as far as
                        she was concerned ; she stood abaqlately by the Mad. 'rid Treaty, and
                        claimed her tall rights. The point was perhaps an insignificant one, not
                        worth all the fass that has been made about it, since France always declared
                        her intention of preserving the open door, and there woald have been ample
                        time for Germany to ory oat when she was actually chreatened. Still she had
                        a right to make her voice heard at any time if she'thought her interests
                        were in any danger; and no one would object to her endeavour to make her own
                        position quite clear. | Unfortunately, she- dragged politios into what was
                        really an economio question. She . believed, or professed to believe, that
                        the Rronoh were aiming at a sort of protectorate over Morocco, "and that,
                        while nominally adhering to the prinsiple of the open door at the porta,
                        they would opposo German enterprise in each matters as financial and railway
                        exploitation. Booba polioy would, she contended, be contrary to the spirit
                        of the Madrid Treaty. In order to prevent the realisation of such a
                        protectorato Germany is det soined that the seounty of life and property in
                        Morocco must be guaranteed by some sort of interna cional control, and not
                        by Pradoe alone. l'he proposal she is believed to have in view is one which
                        will hand over the policing of Morocco to some disinterested Power who will
                        be the mandatory of all the civilised nations, She will leave to France the
                        task of polioing tbo Algerian frontier – that was oonoeded from the first in
                        the negotiations which led to the acceptance of the Conference ; and Spain
                        will be allowed a similar privilege in the parts of Morocco adjoining her
                        territory ; but the rest of the country must be placed either ander an
                        international commission, or else | under the control of one neatral and
                        disin terested Power. And it is understood that Germany would prefer the
                        latter alternative. | There are several objections to the German soheme.
                        First of all it would be difficolt to Johoose the nentral Power. Even if a
                        nation like Denmark or Switzerland were willing to andertake the task, the
                        necessary anthority: would be lacking. On the -other hand, if Italy or
                        Austria were soggusted, France would certainly feel affronted, Italy is a
                        Mediterranean Power like Franoe. Why should sbe be asked. to step into
                        Morocco and perform a task whicb, it is alleged, cannot be undertaken by
                        France withont injary to the interests of Earope! . Indeed, it is diffioult
                        to see how any Power, bowever disinterested in theory, can besked to dearp
                        the position which France had mark | d out for herself. To accept such a
                        mandato would be to ooort the enmity of the French p:ople, and that in
                        itself would surely debar Italy from stepping into the broach. The ides of
                        an international commission is rstbor less open to objeotion, but the
                        experienco. of interTuational commisione in hardly encouraging </p>

                    <p>M. Schweitzer gave us of his best at the Savoy Hotel, Cairo, on Monday, and
                        we should have enjoyed the concert even more had not the Tzigane orchestra,
                        which played near the doors of the concert ball, been painfully andible.
                        Whoever was responsible for this was guilty unintentionally, let us hope-of
                        considerable discourtesy to M. Sobwoltzer and his audience. The programme
                        was good and capitally tendered. The Moonlight Sonata and the Lirzt piece
                        delighted all: the writer, if anything, preferred the Schumann selections.
                        M. Schweitzer was at his best in them his technique as admirable as in all
                        his renderings his power of expressing the lyrical emotionalism of the
                        composer at its highest. </p>
                    <p>A Custom House Porters Case. </p>
                    <p>This morning, the appeal of Mr. Luigi Stagni against the decision given in
                        regard to the Custom House Porters Benevolent society came before the Mixed
                        Appeal Court. Mr. Stagni had made a contract with the Society whereby at
                        should undertake the "factage" of his wood stores. But the work did not give
                        satisfaction and some correspondence ensued. The matter came before a judge
                        in chambers, who ordered an expert to give his opinion. M. Mazou was
                        selected. The appeal was against the nomination of this expert on the ground
                        that he was only a nautical expert. Mr. Stagvi demanded that a specially
                        qualified man should be chosen, or if M. Muzou remained he should be
                        assisted in bis investigations by two other qualified men. </p>

                        owing to the unjastifiable increase in the lui tax on 'dnnumbered carriages,
                        which, as of your readers are aware, has been raised from P.T. 50 to P.T.
                        150 per annum. It is abgnrd to consider that this tax will only apply to the
                        177 birds carriages. It will equally apply to over 1,000 private carriages.
                        Is it to be expected that the owners of these carriages are more likely to
                        remain quiet under this imposi tion than are the owners of the semi-public

                    <p>The following anthorised statement in regard to the presence of a Belgian
                        post on the Upper Nile has been issued :-It is an ondoghted fact that
                        Congolese native soldiers anpeared at Inyolo in 1904, and that a "mirsion"
                        of some kind, ostensibly &amp; scientific one, has been in oooupation of the
                        post ever since. The Egyptian Government did not welcome this prolonged
                        stay, especially as the mission and the patives failed to agree. As a
                        pacifio mode of app sing pressure upon the visitors to "move on," it was
                        decided some three months ago to stóp the Belgian transport and post
                        servizos on the Nile, bat, up to the present, the Congolese mission has
                        apparently been able to get sufficient supplies from its Congo base to
                        withstand the inconvenience thug involved. The British and Egyptian
                        Governments are on good terms with the Belgian Government, and there seems
                        to be every hope that the mission will shortly be withdrawn from territory
                        within the sphere of British and Egyptian jarisdiction without the recessity
                        arising for resort to stronger measures than those already in operation.

                    <p>We understand the Menzaleh. Capal and Navigation Co. intend commencing a
                        servic9 € between Matari-h and Port-Ssid (Karponty) in 8 a few days. The

                        accostomed to the bindling of the steamers e onder somewhat new nditions,

                        journey between the two towns. The difficulty at present appears to be for
                        the steamers to attain the estimated speed in! | shallow water. This,
                        however, in no way affects the ultimate succers of the service, for the
                        actual cost of dredging is comparatively small, and it would well repay the
                        company to deepen the canal, if by doing so it were found that b the speed
                        of the steamers could be increased t to that estimated. It is expeoted that
                        very shortly a regular time-table will ba published, a and quick trains
                        between Matsrieh" and i Vansourah will run in connection with the company's
                        service across the lake. The 'a steamers will probably leave Port-Said duily
                        at 1 8 a.m. and it is hoped that passengers will catch the 11.30 train from
                        Matarieh to Man. sonrah.. The disadvantage of Karpoaty as a point of
                        departure will soon be done away with, for within three month, the company

                        will leave for Matarieh from Raswa. We understand the company is negotiating
                        with the Government for acting as salesmen for the fish basiness on the
                        lake, with a view to protecting the interests of the fishermen, who are now
                        completely in the bands of groups of local sheikhs. Parchases of building
                        sites at Matarieh have also been made recently which should yield a good
                        profit. The opening of the Ananieh Canal for navi. gation, insaring a free
                        waterway from PortSaid to Mangourah and even Cairo, is now it ander study.

                        The wife, in reply, alleged connivance and oraelty. | The petitioner, who
                        appeared refore the late Lord St. Helier in 1904, said that he married the
                        respondent at, he British Conga. late in Alexandria in 1899. They lived in

                        birth to a child. Mr. H. Murphy : Have you ever atrack your wife 1-Once.
                        Uoder what circumstances ? - I made a cabinet for a map, and later asked him
                        for payment. He said he had already paid, and showed me a receipt in my
                        wite's hand-writing. On toxing her wth it, she denied her writing, and in a

                        back to Cairo be wrote "in a passion” that her "last card was played," and
                        that he would never let her join him again. In reply she wrote : "My dear,
                        dear husband, - I thought my poor heart was being torn ont. Do not judge me
                        too harshly, Ted, as I have been good to you and the little On88, only the
                        accursed management of money was my only fault, as you know yourself. Try

                    <p>Interesting Picture Exhibition</p>
                    <p>Some fifteen years ago Mesars. Th. Ralli and P. Philippoteaux conosived the
                        idea of starting a small Art Bxbibition in Cairo ; to day the Exposition
                        Internationale des Beans Arts has become one of the features of the BOASon,
                        and numbers among ita patrons ench world-famed artists 24 Messrs. L. Bondat,
                        F. Cormon, L. Herpignes, Carolus Daran, L Lhermitte, B. Dameron, E.Detaille.

                        . 1 There are many important canvagas in the present exhibition-notably ONA
                        very larga one (No. 243) Le Bain dos Nymphes, hy Alfred Planzean, which was
                        in the Salon last year. The composition and coloaring of this vy of bathing
                        nymphs startled at the appearance of the satyr, are admirable, the cool
                        atratch of water and the green forn-oled banke making &amp; delightfal
                        scheme of colour. In close prox. I. imity is the life-like portrait of Mme
                        G., by Victor Grétin, a beautifal piece of work repre.. senting the lady in
                        black dress and hat and light overcoat standing in front of a doll gold
                        ourtain. Lovers of London atmosphere will experience &amp; certain amount of
                        heimweh on finding at the end of the large room a painting of the La Tamise
                        (No 17) below London Bridge with the dome of St. Paul's looming through the
                        mist, and the foreground filled with the berges and usual river boats. The
                        artist, A. Barbier, has caught the atmosphere and mystery in wbioh our river
                        loves to enfold itself, and one can almost fael the drear gloom of the day
                        as one looks apon its misty half shades. Arthomics (No. 18), hy | Alexis
                        Axilete, is a happy inspiration, The young buntress aglow in the early
                        morning sonlight, and with the young pale moʻn abnye bør bead, is poised
                        with bow ontstretobed, the honnds beld in leash behind her. Mlle. Lonise
                        Abbema is represented by a delightfal bead of a fair young girl in vignette
                        surrounded by branches of wi-teris and a big sheaf of pennies: a delicate
                        piece of work, and very much more to be desired than some of the other
                        soulless studies of feminine baanties. There is not mnoh depth of feeling in
                        Dimanche (No. 5) by Mlle George Achille-Poold thongh the young couple appear
                        to be enjoying themselves, and the details and portraits have been worked up
                        to a wonderfal degree of finish. For mastery of composition, drawing, and
                        minnte detail one must visit Didte complote (No. 67). by Francesco Branery,
                        whose canvas will bear the most minute inspection and whioh is admirable in
                        every respect. His Tóte de femmo (No. 68). in pastel, ig also charmingly
                        rendered. Un cas Embarassant (No. 124), by Mlles Cecile and Mario Deslions,
                        attracts many admirers. It represents a faithfal but perplexer waiting maid
                        disolosing the tattered condition of his garments to the equally perplexed
                        caré, and the f4088 and treatment of both figates are most happily rendered.
                        Soleil d'Au. tomne (No.6), by L. B. Adan, with ite! resting figare gazing
                        from its corner, framed: | by bright green ivy on to the leaflegg woods
                        beyond, is an excellent piene of work; Veillo Ravandeuse (No. 9). by Sem
                        Angerville, is a deli htful study of an old dame smiling over ber work
                        before her cottage window. Albert Guillaume has three canvase* (Non. 145
                        147). Two of these, Ferveur and Gestation, are bis gorious wierd grote quer,
                        Esthetismo haa not mnoh interest. Au Large (No. 256), by Lonis Ridel, b-8
                        made &amp; name but does not appeal to the ordinary eye. The two frail
                        ladies, oled in diaphanong decolleté gowns and bats, stretched apon the deck
                        of a boat amid heaving waves, is in no way convincing, though may be its
                        treatment is high above the average. Espagnolo (No. 180), by Mme Julette
                        Dubufe Webrie, is fine in colouring with its copper coloured draperies
                        against the gold background, bat the features are not distinotly Spanish in
                        type and are faulty in modelling. Miss Elizabeth Noorse has some delightful
                        studies, of child life in Les Enfants de Penmarch and Fráre ot Sæur
                        Bigoudins (Nos. 233 and 234); Un Champ do Bataille (No. 194). by Timotéon
                        Lobrichon, will doubtless appeal to the domesticated mother and lover of
                        children. Napoleon on board the Bellerophen in Plymooth Sound, is the
                        gobject of Jales Girardet's cativas No. 140 m.; it PORFASAGs fome merit
                        though it is sadly over-weighted by the crowd of figares around the
                        battleship. \ Parther mention of the other exhibits will be made at a later
