                    <p>The business of a stateman, said Bismarck</p>
                    <p>&amp; good many years ago, is to see things as they</p>
                    <p>are. What is the statesman’s business is also</p>
                    <p>the business of every citizen in so far as he</p>
                    <p>concerns himself with his country’s affairs or</p>
                    <p>with its relations with other countries. We all</p>
                    <p>want to see things as they are. Yet it is not always</p>
                    <p>easy. What, for instance, (asks the “Morning</p>
                    <p>Post”), is at present the idea and the feeling of</p>
                    <p>the majority of Germans on the subject of this</p>
                    <p>country and of British policy. If we were to</p>
                    <p>be guided in our judgment by what we read in</p>
                    <p>some of the German newspapers we might</p>
                    <p>imagine that the Germans were all filled with</p>
                    <p>apprehensions of some dire design supposed to</p>
                    <p>be cherished in England against the welfare,</p>
                    <p>the expansion, or even the peace of Germany.</p>
                    <p>As no Englishman is aware of any such design,</p>
                    <p>indeed as all of us know that no such, design</p>
                    <p>exists, there would be a temptation to suppose </p>
                    <p>the population of Germany is afflicted with some</p>
                  <cb n="6"/>
                  <p>mental disease or with one of those extraordinary delusions of which a once
                        much read writer wrote a history. But those who have in late years travelled
                        in Germany and mixed with the people in that country have discovered that
                        among the educated class there, the representative character of the
                        newspapers is denied, and it is asserted that the articles unfriendly to
                        England are not the expression of the popular feeling, or, at any rate, are
                        not to be taken too seriously. Between those newspapers which make it their
                        business to preach down England and those cultivated Germans who denounce
                        these newspapers it is hard to get at the facts and see things as they are.
                        The Germans outside of Germany, the travelled Germans, are not anti-British.
                        They generally know something Of England and the English. But they are not
                        always listened to with respect by the Germans at home, at any rate not by
                        all the newspaper writers. It is to be hoped that there will shortly be a
                        change of fashion in Germany, and that the habit of discussing the imagined
                        deep-laid plots of England will die out. Meantime it may help towards the
                        clear view which is so desirable to consider some of the undoubted facts
                        about the German Empire which are apt to be forgotten not only here but
                        there.</p>
                    <p>Germany has for a whole generation been enjoying steady and increasing
                        prosperity. None of the great States of Europe has so much to show in the
                        way of material progress. Most of the large towns have been within the last
                        twenty-five years so transformed as to seem to have been almost entirely
                        rebuilt. The standard of comfort, and even of luxury, attained is beyond the
                        dreams of the last generation. Manufacture, trade, and commerce have
                        flourished exceedingly. The whole country beats on its face the marks of
                        accumulating wealth. For education of all sorts and for the advancement and
                        diffusion of knowledge, provision is made on an ampler scale than in any
                        other country of Europe. These great advances have followed close upon and
                        seemed to be the consequences of the great struggles which led to the
                        foundation of the new Empire as the form and symbol of national unity.
                        Accordingly the national self-conscionsness ‘has been exalted, and Germans
                        today take a legitimate pride in their country, The Army is considered,
                        probably rightly, to be the best organised and the best trained in the
                        world, and the Navy has for a whole generation worked hard to make itself
                        the Army's counterpart. Germany's influence makes itself felt far and wide,
                        not merely in Europe. These are some of the marks of greatness in a nation.
                        The nation that is so well situated in regard to its arrangements for
                        defence, for education, and for trade, and of which the prosperity is so
                        remarkable, can hardly have good reason to be excessively timid or anxious
                        as to the future. Yet there are a number of writers in Germany who seem to
                        spend their time looking abroad for possible troubles, and for several years
                        past they have represented England as the most probable source of danger to
                        Germany. If these writers had all been silent it is quite possible that
                        traders and manufacturers in England and in Germany would have been
                        conscious of a certain rivalry. Mr. Haldane in a spéech the other day, spoke
                        of  “the legitimate antagonism of trade competition.” But it is by no means
                        clear that this antagonism need have a national or international aspect. Two
                        spinners in Bolton are much keener rivals one of the other than either of
                        them of any German competitor,and yet they can manage to live together in
                        the same town without quarrelling. It would not be easy to find a British
                        trader or manufacturer who would wish this country to pick a quarrel with
                        Germany. Some of them would be glad to be helped against German competition
                        by a protective tariff, but they would not on that account wish the two
                        nations to enter into the extreme competition of a war. Moreover, men of
                        business best realise that the best customers are rich industrious nations,
                        and that Germany and England with or without tariffs on one side or on both
                        are necessarily bound to have very large commercial dealings with one
                        another. Apart from manufacture and trade where the two nations are
                        competitors, but not necessarily unfriendly competitors, what are the
                        interests of the two nations which clash? We have never been able to
                        discover them There is no rational cause for a quarrel between England and
                        Germany, and if a quarrel arises it must be due to some wrong, malice, or
                        misunderstanding. These things it is not always possible to prevent. They
                        ought not to arise, and it is the duty of each nation and of each Government
                        to avoid being the author of any such occasion of dispute, and of course
                        also to be strong enough in case of a gratuitous quarrel thrust upon it to
                        defend itself.</p>

                <p>The adjourned meeting of the managers of the big local banks and the heads ofthe
                        private banking houses took place at the Alexandria Offices of the National
                        Bank yestérday. It was decided by the majority of the banks to form a
                        syndicate aud the capital of the concern will amount to a very respectable
                        figure. Unfortunately all the important banks were not unanimous, as the
                        board of directors of the Crédit Lyonnais refused to give their assent to
                        the manager here to join the syndicate on the part of the great French
                        banking establishment. As some of the managers of the other banks had made
                        their adherence to the syndicate conditional on unanimity, the secession of
                        the Crédit Lyonnais has obliged the managers of the Comptoir National
                        d'Escompte de Paris, the Imperial Ottoman Bank, and the Crédit Frageo
                        Egyptien to inform their boards of directors of the fact of this abstention
                        before obtaining consent to forming part of the syndicate. The majority of
                        the banks, however, have agreed and the syndicate: therefore may be regarded
                        as an accomplished fact.</p>
                <p>The refusal of the board of directors of the Credit Lyonnais to allow that bank
                        to join has created a somewhat unfortunate impression in view Of the
                        important position that bank has always held in Egypt. In view also of the
                        fact that it has occupied an official position here as the custodian of the
                        monies of the Caisse de la Dette and has gained considerable influence from
                        such a position, it is considered that the board of directors should have
                        shown their confidence in the stability of Egypt's financial position at the
                        present time by at once giving the necessary permission to their manager to
                        materially assist in ameliorating the severe crisis, through which the
                        Bourses of Alexandria and Cairo are now passing, by coming into line with
                        the other important banking institutions in the country.</p>
                <p>Nothing definite has yet been decided as to the procedure which the syndicate
                        will adopt. We understand that there will be no hard and fast rules in
                        regards to limits, etc. It is suggested that the committee of management.
                        should meet, say, once a week and decide as to the course to pursue in view
                        of the possible fluctuating character of the market from week to week.
                        However,nothing has yet detinitely been decided on these points. At any rate
                        it is a matter for congratulation that the syndicate is an accomplished fact
                        and the constitation of such a body should be of material assistance in
                        stopping any farther increase in the “rot” in the local bourses, which might
                        otherwise have become highly contagious. Capitalists and small investors
                        will now know that the minimum prices are guaranteed and this should induce
                        buyers to come into the market.</p>

                <p>From the “Daily Telegraph" of Saturday, the 18th inst. </p>
                <p>Circumstantial rumours have been current luring the last few days concerning the
                        disapperance of one of the partners of the well known firm of City
                        solicitors. There seems little doubt that the rumours are well founded, and
                        that the Stock Exchange, if not any private clients of the firm, will suffer
                        substantially. As usual, a good deal of loose talk Is heard concerning the
                        sums involved, but there is reason to believe that they have been unduly
                        inagnified, and that they will prove to be below £100,000. It commonly
                        reported that Lord Cromer had been seriously hit in connection with the
                        matter, but we have the best authority for stating that thére is no truth
                        whatever in the reports, so far as his lordship is concerned, and that the
                        late British Agent in Egypt has not and could not have lost anything at all,
                        as his securities are in the safe keeping of Messrs, Barings. It may also be
                        as well to state that the firm in question although they used to act for the
                        family, are not the solicitors of Messrs, Baring Bros.</p>

                <p>The College des Freres in Cairo, situated opposite the new Roman Catholic
                        Cathedral now under erection in the Ismailieh quarter, has just been
                        disposed of to Mr.Moise Levi, of the firm of Zoucas and Levi. The property
                        is a little over 2,100 square métres and the price paid is about £30 the
                        metre. The Freres reveived in part payment the house and grounds belonging
                        until lately to Moustapha Pasha Fehmy, the Prime Minister, the latter
                        property having an area of 6,000 square metres and being situated in Sharia
                        Mansour; it passed into the possession recently of Mr. Levi. The house will
                        be considerably enlarged for the accommodation of the large number of
                        pupils, betwee 300 and 400, now attending the schools and these will be
                        transferred from Ismailieh to the Bab-el-Louk quarter in September. A
                        position of the ground on which stands the present College was purchased 19
                        years ago at 33 franes the metre, and for the land adjacent, on which an
                        extension was built about 4 years back, between £6 and £7 the metre was
                        paid. The next building on which the English Nursing Home was formerly
                        located, consisting of a large house and 1,000 metres, was offered to the
                        Fréres in 1905 at £7 the metre and was bought by Mr. Moise Levi at that
                        price; the latter now asks £20,000 for the property, from which figures it
                        is natural to assume that houses and sites in the Ismailieh quarter of the
                        capital are not declining in value as some persons declare</p>

                    <p>                            Cairo, May. 13.</p>
                <p>Before I left Cairo 1 had the honour of being requested. by his Highness the
                        Khedive to have an interview with him previous to my departure. I have been
                        in friendly relations not only with Abbas II, but with his father, Tewfik
                        Pasha; and the uniform courtesy and friendliness which I have experienced at
                        the hands of three generations of the Khedivial family would alone have
                        sufficed to make the invitation welcome to me personally. I felt, also, it
                        would be interesting to the British public to learn the point ot view from
                        which his Highness regarded the present situation in Egypt.</p>
                <p>All those who heard Abbas II. make a speech at the Guildhall banquet given in his
                        honour on his last visit to London are aware that he speaks English with
                        remarkable facility and accuracy, but I fancy his thoughts run more rapidly
                        in French, and that when he is talking with anyone who can understand French
                        he prefers speaking in that language in preference to English. In common
                        with almost all Orientals after thirty, he is beginning to expand in size,
                        and this fact tends to increase his remarkable likeness to his grandfather
                        Ismail. Another resemblance between Ismail and his grandson is to be found
                        in the moderation of his comments with regard to everybody, even to persons
                        who might, from his own point of view, have given. him cause of offence. In
                        the years of his exile, when Ismail was eating his heart out from his
                        longing to return to Egypt, it was only on very rare occasions, as I can
                        vouch, that he spoke with bitterness of those who had contributed to his
                        downfall. In lke fashion, Abbas II., as I noticed, though speaking with
                        great apparent frankness, never made a single personal allusion to any cause
                        of offence he might have sustained, or thought he had sustained, during the
                        régime now ended which might not have been repeated at the British Agency
                        without giving reasonable umbrage of any kind.</p>
                <p>His Highness expressed his appreciation of the services Lord Cromer had rendered
                        to Egypt by restoring her financial solvency, by encouraging works of
                        irrigation, and thereby promoting the material development of the country,
                        He thought, however, that thé material prosperity of Egypt was due quite as
                        much to the exceptional prices of the cotton crop during the last few years
                        as to administrative causes.</p>
                <p>As to the military occupation of Egypt, his Highness seemed to me to take a
                        common sense view. Without expressing any personal opinion, as to whether he
                        would have preferred another solution of the Egyptian question, he admitted
                        that the logic of facts had brought about the occupation. Egypt was too
                        wealthy and at the same time too weak a country not to fall under the
                        protection of some great European Power; so that, in the event of the
                        withdrawal of the British troops, some other Power would necessarily také
                        the place of England, while no other Power conld do as much as England had
                        done to promote the material prosperity of his country. He believed that
                        this was in the main the view of his subjects, and that, though they might
                        desire a larger degree of independence at home, they were convinced that, if
                        they were to remain under a protectorate, they saw no advantage, but the
                        contrary, in any change of the Power by whom the protectorate had to be
                        exercised.</p>
                <p>If I interpreted rightly his somewhat guarded expressions, I should judge that
                        his Highness does not regard any serious change in the existing relations
                        between the protecting and the protected Power as a probable contingency.
                        England, as he intimated, had had several occasions under her military
                        oecupation during which she might have converted her temporary occupation.
                        into an avowed Protectorate with the consent of the other European Powers.
                        He admitted that England had acted in good faith when on each of these
                        occasions she repeated her declarations that she had no intention of
                        remaining permanently in Egypt; but he'could not fail to seé that each of
                        these refusals on her part to avail herself of the opportunities afforded
                        her had rendered it more and more difficult for her to upset the existing
                        system—under which Egypt was administered by the Khedivial Government,
                        acting under the tutelage of English advisers, without incurring the
                        opposition of Continental Powers. Nor could he perceive what advantage
                        England, even if she were so minded, could hope to obtain by modifying a
                        system under which shé is practically supreme in Egypt, without incurring
                        any direct responsibility. His Highness gave me also to understand that he
                        had never given, any excuse for saying that he had intrigued or conspired
                        against the British occupation, or against the authority Of England in
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>In connection with this assertion he remarked that ever since his accession
                        to the Viceregal throne he had always received the utmost kindness and
                        courtesy from the Sultan of Turkey, and that he entertained for Abdul Hamid
                        the respect due to him, as the spiritual head of Islam, a faith to which he
                        himself was deeply attached, He “delared that he had never given countenance
                        to any ideas that may have been entertained at Constantinople for
                        re-asserting Turkish supremacy in the Sinai Peninsula. Whatever his position
                        as Khedive might be, he had one claim which nobody could contest, and that
                        was his being the lineal descendant of Mahomet Ali, the founder of the
                        reigning dynasty. It was,</p>
                <cb n="4"/>
                <p/>
                <p> therefore, impossible to imagine that he, of all men in the world, would dream
                        of undoing the work of his illustrious ancestor, and thereby replacing Egypt
                        uuder Turkish rule. </p>
                    <p>His Highness expressed in the strongest terms his sense of the courtesy he
                        had uniformly received at the hands of his Majesty King Edward VII, whom he
                        had always regarded with sentiments of respect and affection, If he were in
                        a position to do so, he should never fail to pay a visit every summer to
                        England, not only as a token of personal friendship, but as a proof of the
                        value he attached to the close connection between Egypt and England under
                        the virtual though unavowed Protectorate exercised by the latter over the
                        former.</p>
                <p>With regard to the recent crisis Abbas II said little or nothing. There was not a
                        word uttered by him in disparagement of Lord Cromer or his policy. He paid a
                        very graceful complimentary reference to his lordship’s integrity and
                        ability, alluded to the regret felt at the illness which had terminated so
                        suddenly, and so unexpectedly, his long career as the representative of
                        Great Britain. He also expressed his personal satisfaction at. his lordship
                        having recommended Sir Eldon Gorst as his successor, and remarked that when
                        the new Conusul-General was financial adviser to the viceregal Government,
                        his relations with the Khedive had always been of a very friendly and
                        pleasant kind.</p>
                <p>He then proceeded to explain to me, without entering on particulars, the general
                        principle upon which, in his judgment, the relations between the defacto and
                        the de jure Governments of Egypt should be based by rights. That principle
                        was one of cordial co-operation. He felt assured that the British
                        Consul-General, whoever he might be, would have at heart equally with
                        himself the welfare of Egypt. In his country, as in every other Eastern
                        land, the people could only appreciate a personal sovereign. As the Khedive
                        himself he represented the element of personal sovereignty, in a way no
                        foreign Consul-General could ever do; and he believed the wheels of the
                        administrative machine would move far more smoothly if the native and the
                        foreign administrations worked in harmony together, not separately and
                        singly. All I can Say is that his Highness assured me that, if his advice
                        were asked upon matters connected with native usages, laws, interests, and
                        even principles, this advice would be based on the paramount necessity of
                        maintaining the principles of justice which have been established under
                        British rule. To do justice without fear or favour was, to his thinking the
                        first and chief duty of every ruler. His complaint against the attacks made
                        upon him of late by certain English papers was that they brought specific
                        charges against him, and that when he contradicted these charges in the most
                        positive and solemn manner, no attempt was made to substantiate the charges
                        by any evidence, and no apology was offered. This, he said, was not justice,
                        and he thought British good sense would recognise that this was not in
                        accordance with fairplay or justice.</p>

                <p>Mr. John Rebertson’s question regarding the observation of the Moslem day of rest
                        appears to be rather wide of the mark, perhaps not so much in respect to the
                        Postal Administration but in connection with the observation of days of rest
                        in, the Egyptian Government service,</p>
                <p>There are upwards of forty different holidays in the official calendar, either
                        European or Native and each one of these is strictly observed. If to this is
                        added the Friday observance, the result .is at least 90 days out of 365,
                        without taking into consideration the fact that in most of the Ministries
                        the staff work only in the mornings. It might be further remarked that on
                        the Sabbath day as known to Christians very many of the Ministerial staff
                        are conspicuous by their absence, in some cases following the example of
                        their European chiefs.</p>
                <p>It must not be supposed for a moment that there is the slightest intention of
                        making any comparison or other invidious distinction between Moslem and
                        Christian days of rest. To readers well acquainted with the country and its
                        habits it should be perfectly evident that the member for the Tyneside
                        division of Newcastle has demonstrated in a most. conspicuous manner his
                        extremely superficial knowledge of the country in which he shows such a
                        fatherly interest, based on a visit of a very short duration.</p>

                    <p> The second day of the third summer meeting of the Alexandria Sporting Club
                        was almost as badly attended as the opening day, and, moreover, the racing
                        itself was not sufficiently interesting to counteract the dulness attendant
                        on an empty stand and paddock. The following were the day’s results :</p>

                    <p>A certain Aboudra, having ingratiated himself with an elderly native lady of
                        excellent connections, played upon her feelings to such an extent as to
                        obtain a very complete hold on her affections and incidentally, her
                        fianances, or at least a large part of them.</p>
                    <p>The lady in question, waghida hanem, is very well of and our Don Juan induced
                        her to believe that her relatives sought to end her days by poison in order
                        to enter into their heritage more speedily. To add to the humbug he
                        surrounded his victim with a battery of charms guaranteed to secure immunity
                        from all dangers and finally induced her to leave her home and seek
                        obscurity in the provinces.</p>
                    <p>Some three months ago, therefore the deluded lady left for Zagazig taking
                        with her jewels and money to the value of some £20,000. At Zagazig the happy
                        pair were united, whereupon the relatives of the bride, justly under the
                        impression that the bridegroom was more in love with the fortune of his wife
                        than her person, demanded the revocation of the marriage by the Sharieh
                        Mekhemeh and insisted that the lady be placed under restraint. these demands
                        being accorded, and a family committee having been appointed under the
                        presidence of the Governer of Cairo for the consideration of the questions
                        at issue, the now divorcee was consigned to the care of her brother but
                        refused to rejoin her family, taking refuge with her lawyer; from thence she
                        has disappeared, and no trace of her whereabouts being forthcoming, the
                        family have given information to the police.</p>
                    <p>In spite of a most careful search and the wide publicity given to the matter
                        by the native press the misguided lady has completley disappeared and
                        sufficiently serious allegations are being made in this connection It has
                        transpired that this is not Aboudra's first exploit of this nature and
                        subsequent developments should prove interesting.</p>
