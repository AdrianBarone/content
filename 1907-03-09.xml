                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the

                    <head>Allenburys' DIET</head>
                    <p>The "Allenburys" DIET is a complete milk and farinaceous Food, easy of
                        assimilation, most agreeable to take, simply and quickly made. It is
                        recommended in place of ordinary milk foods, gruel, etc., and whilst
                        acceptable to all as a light nourishment, it is particularly helpful to
                        Dyspeptics, Invalids and the Aged. In the sick-room it will be found
                        invaluable and it is easily and quickly made, the addition of boiling water
                        only being necessary. </p>
                    <p>The "Allenburys" DIET is readily digested by tose who are unable to take
                        cow's milk and is particularly serviceable in convalescence. When taken as a
                        light supper diet it will be found to promote tranquil and refreshing sleep.
                        Although this DIET is a good for ADULTS and is entirely distinct fom the
                        "Allenburys" Foods for Infants, yet it is also of great value as a
                        restorative food for young children, especially during convalescence. </p>

                    <p>The Entente has brought about some unex. pected results, but none more
                        curious than the publication of “Gordon Pasha,” by M. Achille Bioves with
                        the sub-title of “Un Grand Aven. turier du XIXe siècle.” It is perhaps
                        natural that the hero's last biographer sh uld dwell at greater length than
                        his predecessors on that religious side of Gordon's character which must
                        seom the most strange to French eyes, and in his chapter on "l'apôtre” he
                        goes at some length into what he calls the "conversion" of Gordon and the
                        mysticism which almost made him an heresiarch. For the rest, he does full
                        justice to his personality, and sums up the problem by describing him as
                        neither a great general nor statesman, and perhaps not even a skilful
                        governor, but one of those scarce beings who sacrifice themselves to the

                        Cairo, has contributed the following interesting article to the "Atrion
                        World,” which is one of a series he is publishing in that paper on his
                        previous visit to Egypt:</p>
                    <p>For the Knabben estate the Khedive has imported the most modern American and
                        English farm machinery, in order to demongʻrate the advantages of tilling
                        with modern appliances. The dairy, kennels, and poultry. yard at Koubbeh are
                        supplied with selected animals and fowls from every olime, and their
                        distinguished owner takes the kernest interest in these departments. For the
                        word people there is a model village, with mos'ne, eohool, and
                        meeting-place--all mort generously supported by his Highness to demonstraté
                        the benefits of order, cleanliness, and community of interest. Amongst other
                        well-organised institutions there is a fire brigade, with English apparatus,
                        whose drilling and tarn-out, I was 2880 red, would be credible anywhere.</p>
                    <p>KHEDIVE AND HORSE BREEDING. I learned in entally that Eżypt's gifted young
                        ruler maintains from his private parse &amp; special commission to improve

                        during the Cairo BO280D, when it often happens that the Khedivial colours
                        are married to victory by his Highness's native jockey. The Khedive greatly

                    <p>It is very dit salt to dismiss the many de. ligh'fal pastoral an i idyllic
                        scenes of the Koubbeh Estates without referring to the most important recent
                        development in con. the connection with them-viz, the fact of his Highness
                        having given the whole of the ground immediately surrounding ling the Palace

                        alfa lancial group, with the object of forming an entirely now healthy
                        residential suburb. conveniently close to pity, which is almost certain in a

                        which is steadily expanding and has apparently not yet rosobe i its zenith
                        in prevent valaer. There have been no violent Alictuations; prices have
                        mounted continually; sometimes slowly, 800e. times sharply, bat always
                        ascending. Some Daroels of land in the Rye Moraski - which is bu Oxford

                        Bank of England. The ground on which the British Agency stands was bought by
                        Lord Cromer at 78. per motren not many years ago, and £40 per metre was
                        refused for it last year, whilst certain wig pAdres have been shaking their

                        distant</p>
                    <p>Let as calmly face the facts. Cairo is by far the largest town in Africa,
                        where East meets West, and is rapidly becoming the greatest om. poriam of
                        Oriental trade, the real balto-way house and Eastern Exchange for many vala.

                        Everyone who knows anything of Bgy tian trade to-day will emphatically reply
                        "No." 'Twenty-four years of settled government, the wise fustering of trade

                        splendid future of this unequalled city. Ito population, which is now
                        nearing a round million, shows every sign of increasing, and Egypt's

                        attention, and our readers require no statistics to convince them that
                        values in these controls have increased substantially within the last two
                        years, to the advantage of property owners and the powernas land agents and

                        nicely by its author, bat it is practically theoretical, and will be found
                        impracticable in many respects. His interference with the Imperial Yeomanry
                        has 010sed much alarm in that force, and if he carries on his avowed
                        intention of red knowing its status to that of the regular forces he will
                        assuredly rain it The Yeomanry are drawn from a very limited class, and
                        socially they are at the blood of the auxiliary forces His proposal to
                        amalgamate the Militia and Volunteers is preposterous 08. The two forces
                        will no more amalgamate than nil and water. They are in many respects

                        which they have in view, because onr invest: ments are in the natare of a

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm
                            as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly
                            warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too
                            early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p><cb n="3"/></p>

                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers of the P.&amp; O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                            Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                            British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                            steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made
                            without change in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp; O. Brindisi
                            express from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria
                            to Marseilles and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from
                            Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail
                            S.S. Co., have also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected
                            and sent to any address.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi
                                rend="italic">Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and
                            the drive up to Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour.
                            In and around the town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is
                            of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting
                            place for the ascent of Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The
                            Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over the island,
                            are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history,
                            having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413,
                            and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                            is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO,
                            with about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys
                            a delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                                <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and
                            close to it the church of <hi rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli
                                Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum,
                            Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a visit.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="item">
                        <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to
                            Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding
                            country. In Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing
                            interest, whilst the local promenades and excursions should not be
                            omitted. <hi rend="italic">The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and
                            fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale
                                dei Colli</hi>, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years
                            ago, goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The
                            most delightful excursion outside Florence is that to <hi rend="italic"
                                >Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300
                            feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from
                            Florence to <hi rend="italic">St. Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel
                            railway to <hi rend="italic">Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of
                            oaks takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to
                            view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at <hi rend="italic">Borgo San Domino</hi> and in
                            half-an-hour you are at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea. No hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of
                            the beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                                >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi

                                rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs
                            from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Porlezza</hi>
                            on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in

                            and is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso,
                            situated above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting
                            paintings, “Entombment," by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by
                            Bramantion.</p>

                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se
                        purger, l'heure et le repas qui lui conviennent le mieux, selon ses
                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
                        cela est nécessaire.</p>
