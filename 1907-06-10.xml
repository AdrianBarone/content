INDIAN UNREST,

The news from India for some weeks past
has been read by those who take an interest in

| the welfare.of that country with mingled. feel-

ings. ‘It is distressing to observe that. a part of
the result of the policy which lias tried to give
Western instruction to‘all who were willing te
receive it, has been to creaté.a class of writers
and speakers Whose one aim is to overthrow
the Government that has made their existence
possible, It is distressing also to see that ithe

| | class of writers and speakers just described

have attained to a .considerable influence aver
a portion of the Hindu population. On the
other had, there is some’ satisfaction to be
derived from the fact. thatthe Indian Govern
ment has not by the knowledge that these
conditions exist been scared into any hurried

‘| departure from its idéals or from its methods

of government, and that evon when the preach-
ers of anarchicll doctrines have led their
| hearers into excess there-has been no rash into
reprevsion; but only a moderate and sparing
wee of powers, which the Government has long

‘possessed but rarely uséd, of'removing to safe

places “the inciters to disorder, The’ redent
steps taken! by the Jatlian Government, happily
with the entire conqurrence of the Government
at home, have had periiaps a more salutary

“| series of sedition seems also to be a

 

a wholesale display of force or by ‘a severe

course of repression. The campaign of mis-
Tepresentation and invective, accompanied
by demonstrations of disloyalty and attempts .
at terrorism, together with the organis
ed boyeott, whieh began in Bengal has. made
its way into the Panjab, te the great. disgust
of the lajal Mobaméaddans, The removal of a
few leaders’ to distant places of seclusion has

hada quieting effect and the deportation of :

another agitator from Amritsar, announced last
week, will help | to convince the. others’ that .
their ‘oécupation is not for ever to bé tolerated.
The Cireular sent by the Indian Government
to local, Governments pointing out the
messures that may feasonably. be taken to,
prevent schools.and colleges from being nur
aur in the
direction of the restoration of tranquility, Very
welcome, too, is the resolution reported this
morning empowering local Governmerits to pro:
secute newspapers that, publish articles inciting
to disturbance. The natural tendency ob ob-
servers at homé in presence of sedition in India
is to urge the Indian Government to put it
down with a strong hand. That is a tendency
to which we do not wish:to yield. The Indian
Government. is better informed than, any
observers hire, and is mote keenly aware of
the possible consequence of its action than can
be.sny crities int this country! ‘It iy not only
informed birt, ‘responsible, Accordingly the dutyé
of good, citizens in this country is to uphold
the Indian Government in’ every possibie way,
even’ to the extent’ of remembering ‘that every
human Goverhment is liable to ‘aul mistakes

and therefore of abstaining from microsdopic
criticism of its action’’

One of the chief difficulties of any Govern-
ment, which like that of Great Britain is
orgenised upon democratic principles in so far -
that it is responsible to-n Parliament, is that
in dealing with.theaffairs of distant countries,
‘specially of countries of different society and
speech from our own, there is always the
possibility of criticisms made: upon it in the
ordinary -course of Parliamentary: life being
niisinterpreted at the other end’ of the tele’,
graph wire. If one party is in offive, and the
other party, being in opposition, discusses
freely the executive or other acts of the
Government, persons ata distance may infer
that this country is divided and drsiors has
no strong ‘will. Such an impréssion, if it should
be produced or encouraged in India just now,
would be most unfortunate, Wo. venture: to
hope that it will not be prodaced, It is firtu-
nate that the Viceroy of India appointed by
the late Government :has the confidence of
their snccessors. It is fortunate that the res-
ponsibility to. Parliament for the government

of India is in the hands of Mr Morley, in -

whose character and ability both partios have
complete confidence. There are, ‘of ‘course,
many who do not agree with sdme of Mr,

Morley’s political theories, theories which we +

have often had. oecasion to’ criticise, But
Mr. Morley id a worker, a great student, an
administrator of more than ordinary power;
There is no fear in his case of a failtire to grasp
the nature. of a situation, or of a weakness in
decision or in tenacity of parpose, His conduet
rand that of the Government of India in dealing
with the agitation: and the -disturbanees in
India will hardly bo the subject” of. criticism
‘from the Opposition. It would, we ventire to
think, be a misfortune if any embarrassement:
were caused him by lack of sympathy from
among those who are as a rule the supportérs
of the present Government, :
‘The doctrine now, taught by some of thos
‘Hindus whoa few yanrs age were represented
as the advocates of the gradual introduction of -
representative methods and a constitutional
system into India, is that of overthrow of the
British Government as soon ‘as possible, by the
plan of passive resistance and of a strike of all
natives in Government émpléy, and if that fails ’
then by ‘conflict. While such a theory is
preached in | dia it appears. to, us that no
Englishman; “Wliatever his theory of Govern:
ment, may be, édn without injuring his country
and India; express sympathy with: any form
of Indian propaganda. In doing so he would
be playing with fire. In Thdia itis the class
that has had the benefit of European  insteue-
tion that expresses extreine dootrings, and
observers in England should: bear in mind that
these doctrines are preached to people un
accustomed to political debate and still more to
that political action which is partof the daily
life of the people of this country. Those who’ wil
support the Indian Government in tieasures for
restricting the liberty of the Indian Press to
spread denunciations of the-British administra-°
tion do so on the ground that the conditions of
India are not those of England, Here, there are
always newspapers-on both sides, There is no
danger of the cause oflaw having no expo-
nents. But in India the case is very different,
Of those who have had a literary training
perhaps the pickare in Government employ or
in’ such other employment as is not consistent
with their being journalists, But those whose
literary instruction has not opened for them
a career in the public service ate exposed to
the temptation, not always resisted, of seokintg
influence and ‘notoriety by attacks on the
Government. Ina country where instruotion,
‘ever after many years of Goy ernment effort to”
sptead it,. is the privilege of'a very few, the
Govertiment is not dnly entitled but bound to
exercise some supervision to-prevent jits being
misused, No doubt the great powers possessed
by a Government like that of India could
conceivably be misused, ‘Everyone will admit
that in theory, But in practice the character
of the Indian Government and its splendid
tradition of equity and tolerdnce area great
guarantee, and to those people in this country
who favour the development of self government
in. India, as elsewhere, there could be no better
guarantes that the Indian Government will not
misuse the powdrs which it possesses. for
dealing with sedition and disturbande than the
character of Mr. Morley, It is not likely that

effect than ‘might have been - produced’ : by ™ will err on the side of unnecessary severity,

ENGLAND'S GRATITUDE.

 

AMUSING “NATIONALIST” REPLY.

Mustapha Pasha Kamel appears to be
very’ greatly enraged by the granting of
the freedom of the City of London to
Lord. Cromer asa mark’of the high esteem in
whicli his work in Egypt is ‘held at home. Ina
remarkable and amusing article the “Egyptian
- ird” takes Reuter’s Agency and the

pondents of the Occupation Press to
ia for having emphasised the honour and
significance of such a conferment. The same
paper insinuates that no mention was made
of a similar conferment on Lord Lister, but we
humbly beg to refer the. writer of the article
in, question to the issue of the “Egyptian
Gazette” of Thorsday the 6th inst. The repro-
duetion of the article will give further proof
to our readers abroad that Mustapha Kamel
can hardly be actuated in his writings by a
reasonable spirit, for no reason for such an
outburst of rage could be offered by any of his
supporters. It is: somewhat amusing that the
artidle insists upon the omission of Lord
Lister's namein the telegram announcing the
honour to Lord Cromer as being wilful, where-
as the heading 1eads “careless omission,” We
might also remark that Mustapha Kamel has
at times taken pains to point out that it was
only Lord Cromer’s policy which he attacked,
while this article shows extreme personal
venom. The following is the text in extenso:—

“It will be remembered what a fuss was made
over Lord Cromer’s being offered the freedom
of the City of London.

“Reuter’s Agency and the correspondents of
the Occupation papers wired in magnificent

enthusiastic terms, the glorious news of the

unparalleled honou conferred upon the great
Earl of Cromer by the stupifying generosity

of the City Corporation.

“And Cromerites were thunderstruck. They
remained bouche-bes. They gushed all over

with pride and felt patriotic-——-Cro-merrily’ pa-
triotic—and cheered the, ex-pro-Consul and
praised the Lord that they were Imperialists

“But what neither Reuter’s Agency nor the

correspondents of the Occupation papers stated
—they even shunned it as doth a mule a tin-
can—was that Lord Cromer:was not the only

Lord whom it was proposed to hononr in the
way.

“Of course they did not state so. It would
have detracted from the importance of the
unparallelism, which they wished to impress
upon the Egyptians.

“So naturally, with the remarkably fine,
gentlernanly sense of impartiality which cha-
racterises the Imperialist bogey press, they

left the other Lord out in the cold, and passed

over the honor conferred upon him with com-
prehensible though not exactly justifiable
disdain,

“Who was the other Lord ?

“Ps — Lord Lister—a somebody, perhaps a
nobody in Cromerite eyes, but. still a greater
man thar the Earl of Cromer was the genius
whom the City Corporation offered in the first
place, thie freedom of the City of London.

“Tt is/excusable perhaps, this omission on the
part of Reuter’s Agency and.the correspondents
of the Imperislist, justice-loving press. Because,
blinded by: their fatuity for Lord Cromer,
they ignore the existence of all other Lords.

“We are sorry to-day to have to throw a
backet of cold water upon their rejoicing and
at the same time to reveal to the impartial
members of Egyptian society to what moral
extremes the Imperialist press can go when
bent upon furthering imperialism regardless of
the colour or nature of the means they employ.

“Lord Lister, with Guthrie and Pasteur one
of the greatest ‘saviours of humanity; Lord
Lister, the propagator ‘of antiseptic surgery ;
Lord Lister the eminent surgeon who had
saved the lives of thousands, hundreds of
thonsands of doomed invalids and_ sufferers ;
Lord Lister—well Lord Lister dwindled away
‘at-the shadow of nothing beside the gigantic
hero of Denshawai, beside the man who would
not’commutate an unjust death sentence, who
officially insulted the religion of three hundred
million souls as might have done a fanatic
missionary.

“Dwindles away to nothing/Ab, time will
say ! :

“'o-day, and inspite of Reuter’s agency and
the correspondents of the’ Occupation press,
the gratitude of milions repays Lord Lister
for his deeds, whereas a few stock-brokers,
bondholders speculators, financiers and ¢a-
pitalists—together with their officially trampet-
press organs—are the only grateful debtors of
the Earl of Cromer.

“And to think that the /reédom of a city has
been given to a man who has become eminent
in Imperialist arenas because he refused to
give freedom toa country! Itis the non plus
ultra of political irony.”

LECHAT ANE CASE. °

_ HEARING CONCLUDED,

 

oa consequence of the great im
to the Lechat-Ganem assault. case
atcrs extravagant articles, which appeared
in many of the local newspapers, the public
attendance was enormous at the second hear-
ing of this case, which took place on Thursday
morning at 10-80 a.m. before the French Consul,
Mr. Paul de Reffye, who was assisted in his
difficult task by Messrs: Favenc and’ Bianchi,
After many witnesses had been called, Maitre
Widal, counsel for the plaintif rose, and, in

the course of « lengthy address, eloquently
referred to the evils and discomforts. attribut-

able to hasty tempers. He further pointed out
that, the-opprobrious and insulting terms,
which his client, Mr. Cheki-Ganem, is alleged
to have used towards the defendant, were tot
proyed, and that according to the evidenoe,
no, provocation whatever had been given to
justify so brutal an attack. During his

M. Widal frequently appealed with great. ex-
citement to the President, for the

of the Tribunal, stating that it was quite
possible for him to proceed, while the defendant
was permitted to insult him, The. President,
however, was unable to admit thatany cause
for complaint had been established and held
that the case must continue.. M. Widal, who
was evidently much upset by this contretemps,
soon after took his seat.

In reply to M. Widal, M. Guithaumon
delivered a stirring defence. He related in
detail and, with many humorous remarks, the
scene which ocedrred’ at the theatre, and
expressed his hearty approval'of the manly
way in which his client, at last goaded beyond
endurance, had endeavoured to .put a stop to
the insinuations and abuse to which he and his
wife had been exposed. He then proposed to
read a letter to the Court, which Mr. Ganem
had written in April last to Mme. Lechat, but,
by request of she plaintif, who objected on the
grounds that he did not desire the members of
his family to be dragged into the case, the
President ordered the letter to be withdrawn.
In short, M. Guilhaumen pleaded: great o
vocation and suggestted that his client’s
tions were, under the circumstances, justifiable
M. Padoa then replied in a few well chosen
words, and, after much heated - discussion
between counsell the case was eventually
brought toa close, Judgement was deferred.

Until-1886-1887 it appears that this. article,’

imported into Egypt, came almost exclusivity | allots on the qu

heqn started at Limassol and Larnaca, which
haye succeeded in delivering, to the Egyptian
market an excellent quality. of white plaster of
very fine grain, the price of which is as stated
aber. ‘Theshipments are made in small sailing
versols at a freight charge of 5 to 7 franos the

Marseilles is inferior to the corresponding
quality from Cypris, although costing more ;

ibtléss owing to the difference in freight.
“the manufacture of plaster in, Egypt has
had some development, we’ are told, since it

be liable to flake. ‘off, and therefore does’ not

The only period during which conditions.were.
at all unsettled was from the 4th. to the
7th; This was:a time of low. pressure over
‘Lower Egypt, but Khamsin conditions ‘were
not experienced except in Alexandria on the
morning of the 6th. Lightning was seen “in
Alexandria on the 6th. and -in Cairo on the
6th. and 7th. ‘The close of the disturbance was

marked by light rain at Alexandria and Cairoy |.

‘For the remainder of the month conditions
were undisturbed and accordingly the average
atmospheric pressure in Egypt was somewhat
higher than the normal arid the avérage tem-
perature somewhat lower, There were no sudden

changes of wind or temperature, nor were |.
