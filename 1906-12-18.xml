                    <head>THE UNIVERSITY OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>An article in a recent issue of “East and West” deals ably with the question
                        of the pro- posed National University. Our contemporary says :</p>
                    <p>The papers of last week reported the election of a permanent committee and
                        certain office- bearers for the great project at a meeting of subscribers on
                        the 30th ulto. The reports show ed clearly that the movers in the enterprise
                        are beginning to feel keenly the initial diffi- culties inseparable from
                        such great schemes, are admitting them to themselves, yet are not making
                        them occasions of despair, but of fur- ther and more sustained effort. It
                        was rightly pointed out by the gentleman who has been elected to the
                        honourable, arduous, and intense- ly responsible post of vice-president that
                        in setting their hands to this enterprise they had staked the name of Egypt
                        before their coun- try, before the Government (as was explicitly
                        recognised), the foreign residents, and Europe , iteelf. That is perfectly
                        true. May so tremen- dous a thought only nerve them to win the stake, If
                        they do, they will have done a service for this country even greater than
                        the imme- _ diate service of giving it a university. This is why no
                        well-wisher of this country and its people can help wishing well also to the
                        men who have taken on themselves so enormous 4 responsibility, always
                        provided that the note struck in the original manifesto is going to dominate
                        the whole project in the future.</p>
                    <p>The meeting on the 30th November was primarily for the election of a
                        committee and office-bearers, so that it is perhaps hardly fair to criticise
                        its proceedings from any other point of view. Otherwise one might say that
                        too much was said about the raising of the money needed, and too little
                        about what seems to us the more important because more imme- diate duty,
                        viz., the fanning, and in the large majority of cases the kindling, of the
                        flame of public spirit throughout the country, and the winning of the
                        confidence of all the public- spirited men that may already exist, so as to
                        enlist their support. Unless this is done, it is hopeless to think that any
                        number of appeals, or desperate and undignified expedients such as lotteries
                        (which we earnestly hope will be tabooed), will produce a fraction of what
                        is necessary. How, then, are. public confidence and public spirit to be
                        aroused, maintain- ed, and enlarged? That is the question of questions for
                        the newly-constituted committee and officers, Clearly this task is a far
                        greater and more radical one than a vast begging- campaign, public
                        subscription-lists, compli- ments all round, circu’ars, letters to omdehs,
                        and all such familiar and time-honoured devices. The thing is too vast, too
                        serious for this. We reiterate once more our conviction that the country
                        needs educating upon the question of university education. Probably very few
                        know even what it means, or how it differs from the collegiate education
                        already supplied, or what practical modifications of the present system it
                        will involve, or whether it is a necessity or a pleasant luxury. The
                        manifesto shows that at least some of the leaders have a grasp of the above
                        questions in principle, but it is very possible that even they require much
                        further study of practical, all-important details. We repeat that study is
                        what is first needed; study and the means of con- tinuously, effectively,
                        and rapidly communi- cating the results of that study throughout the
                        country. The Universities of all the chief countries of the world, and more
                        particularly India, should be studied and the applicability of their systems
                        to Egypt carefully reported upon. Their various solutions of the religious
                        problem should be noted. Information about their relation to technical and
                        professional education, their solution of the residential problem, the place
                        taken by athletics in them, their discipline, ordering, and governance, —
                        should be massed and systematised, and debat- ed and corresponded about in a
                        Review specially for the purpose. All this clearly means the spending of
                        money for the expenses of such a commission, and of such a Reriew, for the
                        latter should not only be the best- editéd and best-got up Review in the
                        country, but should, with other pamphlets and publica- tions issued from the
                        same office, be pro- duced at prices which should render the widest possible
                        circulation feasible. There are always some who have not the courage to
                        spend money which will not yield an immediate and visible return. But the
                        di- rectors of this enterprise must not be of such poor calibre. Long views.
                        and not short ones are needed, for it is a long future for which they are
                        building. We respectfully com- mend these thoughts to the notice of the com-
                        mittee, with our hearty good wishes to them at the outest of their laborious
                        work.</p>

                        761 concealed in his boots, and P.T. 1,414 was found in the possession of
                        the other. In the course of the enquiry they admitted the theft.</p>

                    <p>Education is the order of the day nearly everywhere ; in Egypt this question
                        is very complicated. Nevertheless, as regards langua- ges, at the Berlitz
                        Schools (Cairo, 1 Sharia Kamel; Alexandria, 12 rue Rosette) the num- ber of
                        pupils continues to increase because the Berlitz method is the ‘royal road
                        to learning languages, being the most logical and the most practical.

                    <p>Affray on Steamer.</p>
                    <p>A serious brawl took place on the Russian steamer Tchichatcboff, which
                        arrived at Alex- andria last Saturday from Odessa and the Pireos, As she was
                        nearing Crete the deck passengers, mostly Armenians and Greeks, came to
                        blows. The Armenians made them selves somewhat too free with the Greek
                        women, which their men folk fiercely resented. A conflict ensued, which
                        lasted for some time, and which was only terminated by the stre- nuous
                        efforts of the captain, officer, and crew. A number of the combatants were
                        put in irons and handed over to the custody of the Alex- andria police on
                        arrival,</p>

                        of, much less to have taken photographs from. Por all the difficulties the
                        photographs were taken with perfect results, results which will be

                    <p>An Exciting Soene.</p>
                    <p>A most exciting scene occurred yesterday afternoon in the main street of the
                        Attarin quarter of Alexandria. A middle-aged Greek woman, belonging to a
                        respectable family, suddenly threw herself on the tram line just in front of
                        a passing tram. The street was crowded at the time, and many of the
                        bystanders were paralysed with terror at the painful spectacle. Just as the
                        tram was about to put an end to the woman’s life a Greek gentleman, of the
                        name of Orestes Notares, rushed forward and picked her up in the nick of
                        time. She struggled fiercely with her rescuer and tried again to effect her
                        purpose. Mr. Notaras called a passerby to his assistance and the two men
                        succeeded in mastering the frantic female, whom they conveyed to her home.
                        The motive for her attempt at suicide was that she was “tired of life.” </p>

                    <head>EDUCATION IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>MINISTER'S OPINION,</p>
                    <p>One of the most interesting features in the Native Press of the week is the
                        interview granted by Saad Pasha Zaghloul to a corres- pondent of “Al Ah-am.”
                        In view of the violent criticism which have long been directed against the
                        Ministry of Education, Saad Pasha’s views deserve fall quotation :—</p>
                    <p>"I have visited three kattabs, four primary schools, all the secondary
                        schools, and certain special schools, such as the Nasrieh girls’ training
                        college, the fikis’ school at Abd el Aziz, the Sanieh and Abbas girls’
                        schools, the School of Agriculture, and the Polytechnic. I noted with
                        pleasure the progress realised by all these schools, and mentioned it in my
                        speech delivered on the occasion of the granting of subventions to fikis,
                        and since published by the Press. I find the organisation to be perfect and
                        the methods of instruction easily followed and underatood by the pupils. I
                        cannot deny that the pupils are making obvious progress. It is true, as you
                        say, that the Press criticises the schools and their methods, but I am
                        vastly astonished at the sort of criticism that is indulged in by persons
                        who have never taken the trouble to visit the schools to learn by ocular
                        demonstration the enormous difference between their present and their former
                        condition. The head masters and pro- fessors do their utmost for the success
                        of their mission ; that isa ‘fait établi,” and I greatly regret that the
                        public does not appreciate their work and their merits. As for the lacuna in
                        instruction to which you allude, these may be derived from certain
                        imperfections in the programs. I have not yet had the time to examine them
                        minutely with the object of learning whether they are complete or not, and
                        so I cannot make any pronouncement on the subject for the moment.</p>
                    <p>“To sum up, the general condition of affairs is flourishing and the schools
                        are making great strides on the path of progress...... I shall be delighted
                        it those who are interested in education in this country, members of the
                        Press, and all who criticise instruction here and its methods, those whose
                        criticism is based upon the necessary experience and knowledge, would be
                        good enough to visit the Government schools so that their critiques, if they
                        have any to make, may rest upon s solid basis. I shall be very willing to
                        take into serious con- sideration all such criticism based upon per- sonal
                        observation</p>
                    <p>“T have remarked the small number of pupils at the School of Agriculture and
                        the girls’ school. A third of the pupils at the former institution are
                        Europeans, while ours is essentially an agricultural country and its people
                        ought to attach much more importance to agriculture than they do. The reason
                        of tic, I hear, is the desire of the students to form part of the personnel
                        of the Government, which cannot content them all.”</p>
                    <p>The Minister concluded by saying that he would do his best for the study of
                        agriculture.</p>
                    <p>Some of our contemporaries were inclined to hint that Saad Pasha had intended
                        to curse the Ministry. He bas obviously remain- ed to bless, </p>
                    <p>Saad Pasha Zaghlonl visited the technical school at Boulac on Sunday in the
                        company of Mr. Dunlop, and was present at the distribu- tion of prizes, at
                        the close of which his Excel- lency made the following speech :—</p>
                    <p>“You have completed your studies, and your success deserves the prizes you
                        have received. I congratulate you all, and hope that your conduct and your
                        industry will serve as a model in the future to your school-fellows. You
                        mast remember that these are not the last of your rewards. Another and a
                        greater reward awaits you, provided you go in search of it. I refer to the
                        benefits you will receive from your country- men if you win their
                        confidence. You will attain this end if you keep always before you the
                        improvement of your work and the perfec- tion of your methods. Follow this
                        end, and you will attain this great reward.”</p>
                    <p>Yesterday, Saad Pasha inspected the Khedi- vial Law School accompanied by MM.
                        Lambert and Archibald, and expressed his great satis- faction with all he
                        saw. His Excellency visited the classes of the English and French sections
                        and asked the students several questions. He also inspected the library,
                        finally leaving at 10.30 a.m. Tin school this morning, and will probably
                        visit some other school in the afternoon.</p>

                    <head> THE NATIONALIST PARTY</head>
                    <p> A FIERCE DISCUSSION.</p>
                    <p>Another amusing storm in a teacup is now raging. The combatants are Mustapha
                        Pasha Kamel and Dr. Nimr, and the subject of their dispute is Mr. Robertson,
                        M.P. Mutapha Pasha Kamel has telegraphed to “Al Lewa’’ from Paris stating
                        that Mr. Robertson has written to the “Times” to contradict the remarks
                        ascribed to him by Dr. Nimrio “Al Mokattam.” The latter paper is very angry
                        and calls the Pacha a “haggas” (scoundrel). The rejoinder to the Pasha’s
                        telegram runs as follows :-</p>
                    <p>That “haggas” (Kamel) who showed when in Cairo that he does not mind the
                        publication of “Al Mokattam,” now clearly shows that that newspaper’s
                        statements have had a very dam- aging cffect on his mind. As soon as he
                        arrived in Paris he sent a wire to his paper announcing that Mr. Robertson
                        bad contradicted what we had said about him in “Al Mokattam.” Bot the
                        “haggas” seems to have forgot- ten that “Al Mokattam” had imputed to Mr.
                        Robertson many things which he can never deny, as can be seen from the issue
                        of that paper numbered 5862. If the preten- sions of “Al Lewa” are correct,
                        and Mr. Ro- bertson has contradicted “Al Mokattam’s” statements, this is
                        tantamont on the part of “Al Lewa” that Mr. Robertson confesses he is a tool
                        in the bands of Kamel. “Al Mo- kattam” is waiting for the “Times” to arrive
                        in order to study Mr. Robertson’s letter, and then it will give an opinion
                        on the matter.</p>
                    <p>The following is the text of an article that appeared recently in “The
                        ‘limes,” which will supply the key to the above-mentioned controversy :—</p>
                    <p>Dr. Faris Nimr, editor of “El Mokattam,”bas published an interesting series
                        of articles on the attitude of the British political parties and Press
                        towards Egyptian questions, as noted by him during a visit to England in the
                        autumn of this year. The last of these articles contains an account of a
                        conversation between Dr. Nimr and Mr. John Robertson, M.P., as to the ru-
                        moured visit of the latter to Egypt at the head of a group of Radical
                        members. Mr. Robertson, after begging Dr. Nimr to deny the story in the most
                        unqualified terms, expressed his hope that the Egyptian public would
                        understand the Radical members of Parliament considered it necessary to keep
                        a careful watch over the policy and administration of the agents of the
                        British Empire in India and in Egypt in order to assure themselves that
                        their methods and aims conformed with British ideas and stan- dards. Their
                        sole object was to raise the moral and material condition of the peoples of
                        those countries. They did not aim at bringing about any changes in England’s
                        position as regards Egypt, they recognized the remarkable services rendered
                        to that country by Lord Cromer, and would never abandon Egypt to the Turks
                        or to itself. Mr. Robertson added that he was now convinced that Mustepba
                        Pasha Kamel’s policy was pro-Turkish rather than pro-Egyp- tian.</p>
                    <p>After the optimistic messages sent from London by Mustapha Pasha Kamel to “El
                        Lewa” and other organs of the Opposition, it bas come as an unpleasant
                        surprise to the Egyptian Nationalist extremists to discover that Lord
                        Cromer’s position is unshaken and that the tirades of Mr. Wilfred Blant do
                        not express the sentiments of the majority of the nation. The fact is that
                        the Oriental, however gifted, seldom understands the real nature of party
                        government and almost always attaches an exaggerated importance to the
                        criticisms which from time to time assail the principal agents of a
                        democratic Empire.</p>
                    <p>Many Egyptian Nationalists doubtless look- ed upon recent Parliamentary
                        attacks on details of British policy and administration in Egypt as
                        manifestations of the distrust of an im- portant, perhaps of the most
                        important, sec- tion of the British people. Identifying the criticisms of a
                        Parliamentary democracy with the manifestations of the displeasure of an
                        absolute Monarch, they imagined Lord Cromer to be in much the same position
                        as an Oriental Vali whose great ability and inflaence had began to arouse
                        the suspicion or the jealousy of a Sultan or of influential members of his
                        entourage.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime Mustapha Kamel affects a lofty scorn of the allegations of
                        the chief organ of “anti-patriots” and. intruders,” but, in spite the active
                        support of the Court party, his reputation must suffer among the members of
                        his party from Dr. Nimr’s disclo- sures.</p>

                    <p>On Saturday, Mme Chaix-Bonheur made her debut in “Trovatore.” We have seldom
                        heard a better contralto—certainly not in Egypt—and one with greater
                        expression and less mannerisms. But the chorus and the orchestra were—well,
                        what they have been for a fortnight, and their display seemed at first to
                        upset the leaders. At the end of the 2nd, act the chorus was fist, the
                        orchestra out of tune and time, and every one with an ear in the audience
                        was looking aghast at his neigh- bour, when M. Escalais appeared, a ‘deus ex

                <p>THE “TIMES” AND RUSSIA.</p>
                <p>ANGLO-RUSSIAN (CO-OPERATION,</p>
                <p>London, December 17. The “Times,” in announcing the withdrawal of the decree for
                    the expulsion of its correspond- ent from St. Petersburg, dwells on the mutual
                    desire on the part of England and Russia to remove all misunderstandings. It
                    urges as the duty of both countries to promote peace and progress in the Mid
                    East, and to prevent the growth of distrust which might devolve that duty upon
                    others. It particularly refers to Persis, where the joint action of England and
                    Russia and their joint counsel for the good of the Persian people and State may
                    restore that interesting Kingdom to « semblance of good government and to «
                    measure of its old pros- perity. (Reuter)</p>

                <head>THE PROBLEM OF EGYPT.</head>
                <p>The following article is contributed by Mr. Robertson, M.P, to the current is-ae
                    of “The Twentieth Century Quarterly.” Mr. Robertson has identified himself so
                    closely with Egyptian matters in the House of Commons that his opinions should
                    be read with interest</p>
                <p>I.</p>
                <p>Postponed problems have a way of growing graver; and one of the many postponed
                    problems of British statemanship is that of the ultimate relation of Egypt to
                    the Ewrire. {t is not disputed that when oar decisive intervention began in
                    1&amp;82, no one foresaw to what it was to lead; and it seems likely that had
                    the foresight been possible, the actual reluctance of our statesmen to intervene
                    as they did would have been raised to the force cf a resolute refusal. To say
                    this may look like ignoring the general satisfaction now felt in England over
                    the results achieved. But that really cannot be ignored. So common, indeed, is
                    complacency on that score, that Lord Milner in his recent defence of his South
                    African policy pointed to the evolution in Egypt as going far to discount all
                    criticism of the line of action taken in South Africa, as regards, that is, the
                    employment of the force of the Empire in the interests of capitalists. In Egypt,
                    he reminded his auditors, the original act of decisive intervention had been
                    denounced as a placing of the nation’s forces at the service of European
                    bondholders, very much as the imposition of Chinese labour on the Transvaal has
                    been denounced in recent years. And the inference drawn was that, whereas the
                    inter- vention in Egypt had turned out very well for the Egyptians, no less than
                    for the bondholders, the courses taken in the Transvaal might be expected
                    similarly to yield the beat results. It is well worth while to keep in view this
                    argu- ment in considering the problem of Egypt on its merits.</p>
                <p>On the face of the case, British supervision in Egypt has been a great success,
                    a8 success, in such matters is commonly understood. That! is to say, the
                    finances of Egypt have been placed on footing of security and order which in the
                    last years of Ismail’s misrule may well have seemed past hoping for. The worse
                    than Turkish methods of extorting taxes practiced by Ismail have been from the
                    first dispensed with ; the budget is as soundly regulated as any in the world;
                    and the people, under an equable fiscal system, have reached a prosperity which
                    in Ismail’s day seemed irrecoverable. So far as most of as can tell, the
                    ordinary operation of law suffers only from the evils inherent in the anomalous
                    system of cousular courts; and the social peace of the country is well
                    maintained.</p>
                <p>Yet, from the responsible British officials themselves, there come latterly the
                    gravest assurances of ground for disquiet ; and there is no lack of non-official
                    confirmation. There is something equivocal, to be sure, about the offi- cial
                    testimonies. In connexion with the la- mentable episode at Denishwai, we were
                    as- sored at the outset that there was on foot a “fanatical movement” so serious
                    as either to make any fall discussion of the trials in he House of Commons
                    highly undesirable, or to constitute a special reason for due delay in
                    criticism—it was not clear which was the meaning to be conveyed. All the while,
                    how- ever, the majority of the heads of depart- ments, including Lord Cromer,
                    were absent from Egypt on leave, apparently in the ordinary course of vacation.
                    Finally, the statement as to “fanaticism” has been formally withdrawn by Sir
                    Edward Grey, apparently as a result of the indignant protests against it in the
                    Egyptian press. We are led to understand, however, that a feeling amounting to
                    “disaffec- tion” is nevertheless common. The official des- patches on the
                    Denishwai affair set it down, in the immemorial official fashion, to the work of
                    “unscropulons agitators,” who are credited with creating the atmosphere which
                    made possible the original attack on the British officers. In saw, Lord Cromer
                    insists that the restoring of the army of occupation to its former strength was
                    the least that could be done with safety ; and that the entire situation is to
                    be understood in the light of the now| celebrated anonymous letter published by
                    him, proclaiming the unchangeable disposition of the Egyptian people in the mass
                    to support the Sultan, as Head of the Faith, in any conflict between him and a
                    European power.</p>
                <p>For the purposes of oar inquiry, the genuine- ness of that letter need not be
                    discussed. It is odd that each a statement as it makes should have to be so
                    established; and Lord Cromer’s course in publishing it would seem to be a rather
                    oblique way of accepting a propo- sition which he has been sometimes accused of
                    disregarding. Such a method is, however, intelligible in view of the fact that
                    the main significance of the letter is as a warning against the danger, not of
                    watchful supervision of Egyptian affairs is Parliament, but of any confilct
                    between Britain and Turkey. Such a warning was expressly offered by Mr. Wilfrid
                    Blant while the Tabab dispute was unsettled ; and no responsible official seems
                    then to have admitted {that there was anything in the argu- ment. Now that Lord
                    Cromer in eff of endorses it, its force may be better recognized But it is
                    important that its real bearing should be understood. As a plea for prudence in
                    regard to Turkey, the Pan-Islamic argument has obvious force. As a justification
                    tor violent and irregular methods of administering justice in Egypt, it is
                    simply self-destructive.</p>
                <p>But we are concerned first and last with the Proposition that after a quarter of
                    a century of British supervision of Egyptian affaire, the mass of the people of
                    Egypt show no general attachment to, or gratitude for, the British connexion.
                    That view of the situation, indeed is not new, though recent writers express
                    themselves as if it wore. Lord Milner offered</p>

                    there?’ Yet the answer is easy. As strangers of an alien faith, possibly of
                    unsym- pathetic manners, we shall never be popular in the sense of being
                    personally beloved. But neither are we unpopular—at least with the great mass of
                    the people—in the sense that they desire to be rid of us.” Even then, the same
                    writer admitted, there were certainly some, and those amongst the most able and
                    vigorous of the party of progress,” who were “sincere in their desire to see the
                    backs of the British troops and of British officials.” The difference now seems
                    to be that the minority of the latter way of thinking has in the last! fourteen
                    years grown much larger. Such 6 state of things, testified to by the official
                    and the non-official elements in Anglo-Egyp- tian opinion, surely calls for the
                    careful shaping of a policy. The ordinary tendency in such situations is to
                    state the facts more or less bitterly, and leave them, with an avowed
                    determination to “put down” anything like active disaffection. The situation is
                    chronic in human affairs, and not at all-special to English administration.
                    There is no reason to suppose, for instance, that France would have managed
                    better in Egypt than England has done. Not only as between England and Ireland,
                    Britain and India, Austria and Italy, Russia and Poland, bat as between masters
                    and men in the industrial field, the situation in question has underlain much of
                    the political strife of the past century. In all such cases alike, “agitators”
                    are accused of setting up factitious discontent ; and “ingratitude” is charged
                    upon the discontented. If we are not to see the same sinister sequence here as
                    has filled the histories of political and industrial strife, it behaves us to
                    face the issue in another temper than that of ordinary racial oppugnance and
                    class hatred. And if any order of men are committed to rising above that way of
                    looking at things, it is the Liberals of Britain.</p>
                <p>II.</p>
                <p>A few general principles should in these matters be by this time above dispute.
                    Firstly, for instance, the principle that when “agita- tors” can be the
                    proximate sources of any grave disquiet, there mast be s quantity of suitable
                    material them to agitate. Given such material, the denunciation of the agitators
                    is one of the standing futilities of human history. Men in Russia are at this
                    moment taking that way of meeting the vastest social upheaval seen since the
                    French Revolution. Bat the folly is one in respect of which me and times
                    different only in degree: and to re- ognize it in Russia and fail to detect it
                    is Egypt is only a folly the more. We have the express assurance of Lord Milner,
                    concerning the people of Egypt, that, as long ag they are not grossly abased, as
                    long as the great duty of government in the matter of water is not too
                    scandalously neglected, there is no fear of widespread public discontent.” Is it
                    in the power, then, of “agitators” to transform the character of a race in a
                    dozen years?</p>
                <p>Secondly, the whole political history of the world should serve to prove the
                    vanity of demanding gratitude at the hands of any race towards a race which
                    rales it. British politi- cians have lately been forced some way towards
                    acknowledging that in matters of sectarian difference it is idle, to demonstrate
                    to any sect that they ought to be satisfied with a given treatment of their
                    claims of conscience. It is time that we should begin to apply the same
                    principle to the relations of peoples. La the days before the recovery of
                    Italian Inde- pendence, the people of Italy were «often told, by others than
                    Austrians, that they ought to be grateful to Austria for the trouble she took to
                    make them happy, and the pains she was at to save them from themselves and from
                    other nations, With Italians, however, the demonstration never succeeded. It is
                    probable that when Edward I. imposed his rale on Scotland he was entitled to
                    Scottish gratitude on various counts. Some Scots, indeed, felt it, and paid him
                    fealty in consequence. Bat the more vigorous spirits did not and would not: and
                    for every ground of gratitude that could be urged on them, they found at least
                    one ground for hate, So, looking to the history of Poland before the partition,
                    we may, if we please, argue that the Poles ought to have been grateful to Russia
                    for saving them from the anarchy of their own vicious political system. Bat the
                    Poles in general have never been for a moment persuaded to that effect ; and,
                    taking a whole era of history for testing purposes, we are shat op to the
                    conclusion that no people that needs convincing of such indebtedness will ever
                    be convinced. Sines, then, it is the business of statesmen to deal with nations
                    as they are and not as they ought to be, it would seem the plain coarse of
                    political common +e28e to recogniz3 that if the Egyptians or the Hindoos are not
                    properly grateful to Britain for what she has done for them, they will never be
                    lectured into the proper frame of mind. Some even say that Britain owes some
                    gratitude to India and Egypt as sources of a multitade of British income: ; and
                    that their, in tarn, makes no British converts.</p>
                <p>Strictly speaking, gratitude is not absent in either of the other cases. Many
                    Hiodoos re- cognize that British rale is better, not only than what would
                    probably ensue if it were saddenly withdrawn, bat than what might conceivably be
                    subsisting now if it bad not be a set up. And a number of Egyptians probably go
                    as far. Bat when this acknowledg- ment is made a ground for charging either
                    ingratitude or unreasonableness upon dis- contented Hindoos or Egyptians, there
                    takes place 8 moral blander on grave that only the omnipotence of human ego can
                    account for</p>

                <p>it. Did any Englishman, let us ark, ever admit the possibility of gratitude on
                    his part to aliens who should enter his country in order to govern it better
                    than it had been governed Perhaps in the period of the French Revolution a few
                    visionaries might conceive of a liberation of England from feudal tyranny at the
                    hand- of invading French republicans ; but certainly no party ever held by such
                    a programme. he men who most emphatically affirm the need for reforms are
                    precisely the kind of men who most entirely take it for granted that their
                    nation shall be free to reform itself. And in our nation, in whose history for
                    many hundred's o! years there has not been a day on which multi tudes did not
                    declare their own country to be misgoverned by their own countrymen, how can it
                    be decently accepted as 4 principle of policy towards any subject nation
                    whatever, that it is iv no sense misgoverned by men of our own race That this
                    principle to commonly proceeded upon in our politics is a deadly proof of the
                    profound insincerity of our relation towards subject peoples. A Tory party which
                    daily denounces liberal misgovernment in Britain, and a Liberal party which
                    confidently affirms the in capacity of Tories to govern Britain properly, are in
                    large part ready to unite in insisting that either Tories or Liberals can be
                    trusted to govern either India or Egypt with practically complete justice is the
                    absence of any system, of parliamentary supervision or constitutional check. It
                    is one of those aspects of life which at times seem to reduce all human
                    existence to the plane of farce.</p>
                <p>The most economical way to answer the above reasoning, I suppose, would be to
                    retort upon me that in politics we mast take mankind as it is and not as it
                    ought to be, and that it is as impossible to lecture racial egoism into the
                    spirit of reciprocity as to lecture discontented peoples into gratitude. Perhaps
                    it is: who can say? I am not affirming that it is easy to induce this or any
                    other nation to do as it would be done by. But go long as nations do maintain
                    the convention of respect for justice and righteousness, : or, in other words,
                    for con- sistency, we are bound to hope on. It is fitting, therefore, to
                    submit-to the attention of Britons this axiomatic truth, that Egyptians and
                    Hindoos must in the nature of things have about as mach cause for resenting
                    misgovern- ment at English hands as Englishmen can ever have for their own part.
                    And there is yet another general political truth which ought to need no
                    pressing, yet is habitually ignored—the truths, namely, that where one race or
                    polity dominates another, whatever goes ill is sure to be aground for special
                    discontent on the part of the ruled - towards the rulers. Englishmen often
                    indig- nantly protest against being saddled with the responsibility for Irish
                    poverty and Indian famine. Ireland, they are sure, would be poor and India
                    famine-stricken under any rule. But what would they have? Are not they in com-
                    mand? Can they rationally expect to meet with nothing but polite acknowledgment
                    of their good intentions in evil times? Do they so treat their political
                    opponents at home ? Cannot they master the elementary law that les maitres ont
                    toujours tort? Do they really expect to carry on the empire business to an
                    accompaniment of votes of thanks? It would seem to be super- fluos, among
                    practical men, to point oat that the first condition of anything like poli-
                    tical content, among men capable of energetic discontent, is that they should
                    have only them- selves, or men of their own race and polity, to blame for their
                    collective troubles. But nothing needs oftener to be urged. Ill By some who do
                    not dispute these proposi- tions as abstract truths, it may be replied that, as
                    regards Egypt, we must be content to reduce the question to one of simple
                    action. Granting that Egyptians may be expected to be dis- contented, whatever
                    be the net benefit to them of British supervision, there is nothing to be done,
                    it may be said, but maintain the present balance. Egyptians must go on being
                    discontented; and the British control most go on controlling. To withdraw it
                    would mean the revival of the direct control of Turkey, the return of the seven
                    devils to the cleansed and ravished house. That Egypt should pass from the
                    present tate- lage, straight to self-government, is as impos- sible as that
                    India should. Such is the sort of general answer commonly thrown at any is who
                    suggests a reconsideration of Egypt’s case. but such general answers either
                    mistake’ lor evade the issue. Nobody in British politics is now suggesting
                    simple withdrawal from neither Egypt or Indias. We are there ; and no criticism
                    of the process of entry by our fathers can solve or affect the problem of ‘our
                    present action. But there is all the differ- ence in the world between the old
                    attitude of Austria to Italy, or of Russia to Poland, and the attitude dictated
                    to British Libe- rals by their own principles in regard to Egypt and India no
                    less than in regard to Ireland. The difference is determined by an acceptance of
                    the principle of evolution. After ages of reciprocal hate and contempt,
                    Englishmen</p>
            </div>
            <cb n="5"/>
            <div type="item">
                <p>look forward to an adjustment of Irish claims that shall mean a lasting trace.
                    Henceforth they can no more apply to Ireland the methods of the autocracy
                    towards Poland than they can accept absolutism for themselves They have
                    renounced the principle of uncovenanted domination. And what they have to do in
                    regard to India, is simply to apply ‘to their relations there the principle of
                    criticism they have latterly brought to bear on the case of Ireland. Not that
                    they can take the same coarse. The cases differ by all the present political
                    distance between the West and the East. But as the reversion to the principle of
                    sympathy and reciprocity was necessary to create any healthy relation between
                    England and Ireland, even 80 is it necessary elsewhere. If tor ages men were so
                    desperately far from that principle as regarded people speaking their own
                    language, intermarrying with them, reading and writing their literature, is it
                    to be supposed that without circumspect revision of their problem they will deal
                    wisely and well with races alien in blood, speech, traditions and faith? In this
                    matter British Liberalism is at the parting of the ways. It has to face the
                    vital issues of imperial no less than of domestic policy. Those issues hang
                    together ; and if either is burked there is no salvation for the party as such.
                    Those who are determined that Liberalism shall go to the root of the social and
                    industrial problem are merely pre- paring their own frustration if they think to
                    elude the other. To fold the hands as regards Imperial responsibilities, leaving
                    the event to routine and the chances of bureaucracy, is to paralyses the very
                    forces of conscience on which they rely for grappling effectually with domes-
                    tic concerns. To ask how far this has already taken place would be to introduce
                    separate albeit important issues. But the more fre- quently the danger presents
                    itself, the mote argent become: the need for provision against it. ln a word,
                    the Liberal party most make up its mind about India and Egypt no less than about
                    the Trade Disputes Bill, the Taxation of Land Value, and Old Age Pensions.</p>

                <p>The competitors in the final of this match, on Saturday, 15th inst., most have
                    been very glorified by the intense interest shown by the numerous ladies who
                    assembled to witness their pl. The teams left in are as follows:</p>
                <p>Reds. Whites. Capt. Dapbar. Major Putterson. Mr. Bentinck. Capt. Leigh.</p>
                <p>Mr. Tollemache. Capt. Hedow. Bir Walter Barttelot. Mr. Aldam.</p>
                <p>The matches throughout the week have been very level, the final proving the most
                    evenly contested of the tournament. At the call of time one goal all was
                    registered. °</p>
                <p>After the 5 minutes interval, the game was renewed with untiring vigour, and
                    although two extra periods were played neither side were able to assert their
                    superiority, the match eventually being postponed to next Saturday, Io the fiat
                    chukker Reds seemed to have the best of the game, Major Patterson only barely
                    saving his gal on two occasions, and Capt. Dunbar making some very fire strokes.
                    In the second Chakker Whites played better together, bat a clever piece. of Mr.
                    Bentinck and Capt. Dunbar gave the lead. This seemed to pat the Whites on their
                    metal ands goal was nearly scored oat of a front of goal by Capt. Leigh. The
                    third chakker Whites were attacking throughout and Capt. Leigh scored a clever
                    goal. They were unlucky not to score &amp; second, Capt. Dunbar bringing off an
                    excellent save on the goal line.</p>
                <p>During the fourth chokker there was s good deal of give and take. Major
                    Patterson, showing great dash, had bad lack not to score for his side.</p>
                <p>The two extra periods produced no goal to either side, and the match will be
                    replayed on the 22nd -inst.</p>

                <p>INNISKILLING FUSILIERS</p>
                <p>VERSUS</p>
                <p>DUBLIN FUSILIERS.</p>
                <p>The above teams met at Ghezireh in a friendly encounter. The Dubs were strongly
                    represented, while the Inniskillings were not so strong as when they met last.
                    The Dublins were in special training all the week, and the way the Skins beat
                    the Lancashire Fusiliers on the same ground, a good game was expected. The Dabs
                    guessed the spin of the coin; and Dougan, starting operations for the homesters,
                    before 3,C00 spectators, play went towards Rice, bat Mullan relieved by sending
                    into touch, The ball now travelled from one goal to another without any result.
                    Higginson now</p>
                <p>initiated a good run. His pass to Kenny was I sent over the line. The Greens then
                    made good headway towards Branagh, who times out of number spoiled their
                    combination. Maloney once gut within shooting distance, and stesdy- ing himself
                    he sent in a terrific shot, which was well saved by Howlett amid cheers. The
                    Inniskillings were playing &amp; good game, and considering the odds against
                    them, they were given as much as they got. Walsh scored a goal for his side, but
                    previous to this the whistle had gone for offside. The free let the boys from
                    the south well up bat Tale, when nicely placed, hended the ball. The homesters
                    got</p>
                <p>away per Hatton, who gave to Higginson, the F latter missing by inches. Play owas
                    in the</p>
                <p>visitors’ end when half-time came with no score.</p>
                <p>After the usual interval and refreshments play was resomed, and the ficst item of
                    any importance was Howlett saving twice in Fsaccession from Tale. The Green and
                    Baff brigade now took play in hand. Higginson and Walsh, combining well, got
                    close to Rice, who h fsaved with mach di:ffizalty. The Dabs, who were playing
                    the combination, got close to Howlett, where Tale opened the avoring with ano
                    unsaveable shot, which Ceebteke had no chance with. The training of the Dabs was
                    baginning to tell, certainly the Loniskillinge feltthe loss of Canningham and
                    Green. Play fhovered in midfiald, and Doagan, getting the sphere, dashed away
                    and gave to Walsh, who joa well into goal. A corner resalted, which was sent
                    past by Ward. The Dablins now forced sthe play, and Howlett was ressiving some
                    “hot ones.” ‘The visitors added a second goal from a corner. Both teame after
                    this made strentooe efforts to add more goals to their side, bat all to no
                    avail. Higginson headed over the bar close on time. From this to full time, play
                    was even, and the end of a good game was :</p>
