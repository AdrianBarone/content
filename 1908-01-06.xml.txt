                <p><hi rend="bold">“THAIS, ”</hi></p>
                <p>“Thais” is full of the usual Massenet charac- teristics, his ‘sensuous’ delicacy
                    and melodious continuity into which break nowandagain points ofirony: this last
                    feature was, as in his “Jon- gleur de Notre Dame,” most marked in’ his treatment
                    of the Monastic- and conventical scenes. Somehow to me certain phases of, for
                    instance, the ‘Meditation” had a slightly Italian flavour, and lacked the light
                    grace so notable in the rest of the Opera. ‘That ‘“Medi- tation” was ;by the
                    way, beautifully played by. M. Martellini, his tone saggested all the soft
                    caressing mystery of Thais, herself—or Mile Genevois as Thais, for that matter:
                    for she was, charming; ‘her voice and technique were. Linstinct with variety,
                    cleat, and faultless. Her invocation to Venus was really excellent. M. de Ryle
                    regained his lost prestige, and) sang quite well throughout. M. Vernet had
                    little enough to do, but gave the impression that the part did not really suit
                    him. The chorus was not q ‘ite 80 good as usaal: there were occasional lapses of
                    decision-in the malé voices. The orchestra was excellent, as was M. Baron, but
                    he occasionally seem’ to lose the sense of the movement of the music, to become
                    slightly professorial.</p>

                <p>Some evil sprite must have got mistaken in the calendar this last week, and
                    mistaken the ist January for the Ist April. Wedo not know how originated the
                    rumour that the Empre Eugenie had arrived in Cairo: but it was substantiated.
                    sufficiently to appear in print, with the result that the Savoy was besieged by
                    all the notables of the place all ahxious to pay their devoirs to the august
                    visitor. Hardly had this rumour collapsed than another was set going to the
                    effect thatthe Savoy was on the eve of closing ite~teors, presdmably ‘from
                    disappointment that the Empress was not within them. This also Aurney out , to
                    bea canard of the most onwarrantable kind. Fat from shutting its doors, the
                    Savoy is preparing many new rooms for the accumodation: of the many guests who
                    are expected within the next few days. Numberless are the applications that have
                    Been received of late :. there have been no less than seven for the suite of
                    apart- ments which aré being reserved for Sir Ernest ‘Cassel and his party; and
                    there are many evidences to prove that even if the season has tarried long in
                    its coming it is going to be gay while it lasts.</p>

                <head>THE SUDAN BUDGET.</head>
                <p>A comparative aioe of the Sudan Govern- ment Reports brings out many interestings
                    facts, says the “Sudan Times,” and indicates the rapid strides of progress, at
                    which the country has beén advancing. In 1900, when Sir R.F. Wingate assumed the
                    administration of the Government of the Sudan, the refe- ‘nue of the country did
                    not exceed LE. 150,000. In the budget for 1908, the revenue is estimated at L.E.
                    1,000,000. In’ other words, in the’ period of seven years the revenue has
                    increased sevenfold which is a very remarkable development.</p>
                <p>In 1905, the revenue from the land tax, inclusive otusbur, was about LE. 30,000.
                    In the budget for 1908, this source: of revenue is estimated at about LE.
                    100,000.</p>
                <p>These figures need no comment. They testify to theable financial management of
                    the coun- try, and to the wholesome general admitiistra- tration, which. has
                    rendered such sncoéss possible.</p>
                <p>Among other interesting facts in the Sudan Budget, we.notice that the revenue of
                    the Sudan Government Railways for 1908 is esti- mated’ at L. E 300,000. It is
                    anticipated that the revenue for the present year, 1907, will reach the figure
                    of L. E. 300,0°:0 against an es- timate of L.E. 250,00). The revenue for 1905,
                    prior to. the construction of the Nile Red-Sea | Railway, was only L.E, 171,000.
                    These figures are aii eloquent testimony to the remarkable development of trade

                    thousand odd coolies came down ‘from the Arab town with their skeikhs and asked
                    the masters what arrange- ment they would make. About‘10 a.m. the sheiks
                    reported that thé men were ready to tesume work under the old agreement. The
                    Masters: met in counsel and it ‘was decided that the men should be called down
                    as,soon as the “black legs” had left the ships. At 11 a.m. everything was ready
                    for the men to \resume work, but in answer to the first call orily 30 men pot in
                    an appearance and it was not till‘after 5 p.m. that a proper start was made.
                    To-day the men baye worked when watited and it is considered that the stnke is
                    ovér. There are now some 30 or 35 vessels in port discharging coal.</p>
