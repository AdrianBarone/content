                    <head>THE ASSOUAN DAM </head>
                    <p>The following extract is from the interesting lecture on "The White Nile and
                        the Cotton Crop", delivered by Sir William WilloockK.C.MG FRGS, in
                        continuation of his lecture delivered on 27th Dec. 1907, at a meeting of the
                        Khedivial Geographical Society on Saturday. Sir William looks to the
                        construction of a barrage at the point of junction of the Blue and White
                        Niles at Khartoum as the most necessary engineering effort wbiob onald be
                        made to save Egypt from the disastrous effects of a low Nile, which though
                        considerably reduced since the construction of the Assouan dam are still a
                        menace to the country. For a sum of less than LE 8,000,000, he affirms that
                        works sufficient for the storing of three milliards of cubic metres of water
                        would be complisher, and the Assuan tr servoir surpasword many times. Toe
                        pasag dealing with the raining of the Dam is as</p>
                    <p>follows:</p>
                    <p>Out of the six milliards cubic metres of water needed for Egypt, the Assouan
                        reservoir will be in a position to supply two For the other four milliards

                    <p>its wide channel about 1,000 kilometres long, with no slope in 500 kilometres
                        and a slope of 1 100,000 in the remaining 500. Nature, which has, as a rule,
                        been so niggardly in Africa bas opened ber lap to Egypt and given of ber
                        good things with a tree hand. While Egypt needed lain in gation for 7,000

                    <p>Since giving my last lecture on the reservoir of the White Nile it has been
                        pointed out to me that the late Sir Betijamin Paker only recommended the
                        raising of the Assuan dam by 7 metres as a counsel of despair His opi Diuis
                        contained in Blue Brok Egypt No. 7 of 1907, which appeared when I was ill
                        and when no professional literatnre was allowed to enter my bands. I have
                        just seen it. Here are his words: "If additional water is a national necer
                        sity. I bave no hesitation in recommending that the raising and
                        strengthening of the</p>

                        alternative plan of a resonable and practical kind can, in my pinion, be
                        deviser for storing the required quantity of water." Sir Benjamin bad dover

                    <p>The White Nile from Khartoum right op to Lake No is, as bas been already
                        pointed out, very nearly a lake in flood and would stay lake for ever if the

                        there is a difference of 8 metres. We want a masonry works which will keep
                        this impounded water where it is when the Blue Nile has tailen, and deliver

                        extraordinary magnitude. The reservoir woull contain some three milliards of
                        oubio metres of water, and would suffice fur Egypt and the Sudan for many
                        years If this combination were not considered the best, a combinationof
                        barrage at the junction of the Blue And White Niles with another at the Aba

                        bring us to the conceptions of the builders of the Pyramids and the
                        construoton of Lake Mæris. Not only cald we store all the water veeded tor
                        Egypt and the Sudan, but I believe we could bave such an effect on a very
                        bigb Nile that the dangers of an inundation would materially be decreased.
                        We are on the thres bold of as wonderful andas startling discoverins as any
                        made by any hydraulic engineers in the world to begin with, three years
                        would suffice to carry out the preliminary works storing three milliards of
                        cubic, metres of water, while the onet would be under L.B. 3,000,000. The
                        Assuan reservoir would be surpassed many times</p>
                    <p>But whatever works are carried out anywhere, the necessity of a reservoir at
                        Assuno remains unaffected. This question was give into thor oughly, and this
                        is the opinion we came to. I quote from my 1895 Report: "We have con cluded
                        that it is absolutely necessary in the interest of irrigation to bave near
                        at band, at the point where the Nile euters Egypt, a reserve of water to
                        meet any contingencies which inight arina. There contingencies might arise
                        from the fact that some of the more important su un mer crops are incapable
                        of standing ten-days' drought, while the summer discharge of reservoirs bigh
                        up the Nile would take many days to rowoh Egyps, and might sometimes be late
                        in arriving"</p>
