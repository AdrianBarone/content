                <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed to
                    Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel accommodation
                    for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr. Najem Houry
                    proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent
                    Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to
                    Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
                    Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                    Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                    begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                    Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                    scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                    in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                <p>“MONDAY OCTOBER 28, 1907.</p>
                <p>REUTER'S AGENOY.</p>
                <p>‘“The-contradictions in the news from India
                this week have been very remarkable,” said the
                “Manchester Guardian” on Oct. 5, “and it was
                eee more important than now, when the
                English people have need to be forming some
                views about our future policy ‘there, that we
                should have news that will not subside when
                we begin to build upon it. .</p>
                <p>“What Mr. Keir Hardie really said we know
                from his own telegram to the “Daily Mail,”
                from &amp; telegram sent by the Calcutta corres-
                pondent of the “Tribune,” and. also from
                ‘telegram published from Reateér’s correspon-
                dent to-day. He had drawn a parallel between
                the Bengal Government and that of Russia only
                in so far as concerned the ubiquity of the</p>
                <p>police and the suppression of public meetings ;
                the parallel’ with Armenia had to do solely</p>
                <p>with the violation of Hindu women by Moham-
                medan rowdies ; and as for colonial government,
                he had said that that was the ultimate goal,
                not an immediate object. or right. These ex- .
                planations may not make Mr. Keir Hardie’s
                speech discreet, but they acquit him of using
                wild words and rhetorical exaggeration.
                “Reuter’s corréspondent eithet did not know
                the context of Mr. Hardie’s parallels or deli-
                berately suppressed it, in which case’he was.
                inflaming English opinion ; and, what is moré,
                when Mr. Hardie returned to Calcutta he was
                so careless.or 80 prejudiced that he again
                ‘neglected to give the context, and represented
                Mr. Hardie’s explanations as an exultant
                justification. Nor is this the first time by any
                means that Reuter’s correspondent has been
                accused of political misrepresentation ; it is
                not long since we published a letter from six
                Caloutta editors pom phainitk ofthe prejudiced
                character of his news ; but this particular ins-
                tance, being a personal and simple one, is
                particularly instructive. It shows that Reuter’s
                correspondent is aman who sees only two’
                colours, black and white,and that his telegrams
                are, therefore, not to be trusted asa founda-
                | tion for judgments in politics, whose colours,
                |i in India, as here, are mostly greys and browns.
                - “This is a very serious matter indeed, for
                Reuter’s telegrams are the only materials for
                opinon on Indian affairs that most people
                have, and they are thé telegrams mainly read,
                largely because the Agency has the reputation
                | of being concerned with the dissemination only
                of. news, and not of views. When an obijoully
                tendencious telegram appears iti &amp; strong party
                organ the reader is on his gttard, and has a
                | chance of correcting the perspective. The
                | announcement that a telegram comes through
                | Reater’s 4 Agency gives no such warning, but
                lulls suspicion. ~
                “The country is, in fact, in danger of having</p>
                <p>F its opinions.on ute warped by a slow, steady
                drip of prejudiced news,,as it was in Sonth</p>
                <p>Africa, In South Africa the problem of news</p>
                <p>collecting was excessively difficult, for the</p>
                <p>whole business was in the hands of a wealthy 
                body of men who were determided. thet there
                | should be no reconciliation, and the home
                Government was more or less in sympathy with
                 them. The conditions are surely not so-bad in
                 India, ‘nor is the India Office committed to a
                policy which would make satisfaction of legiti-
                mate Indian demands impossible......
                | “Reuters Calcutta sBrfeatoodont to-day,”
                ‘continued the “Manchester Guardian,” in its
                | issue of Oct. 7, “sends an explanation of his
                ees messages on Mr. Keir Hardie's .
                8 peech last week. He says that thé statements
                were NA ieoaied absolutely without qualification
                {in the “Statesman,” and _“‘Bengalee,” andother
                papers. That, ifttue, might be held to justify
                | his first telegram, which was given on the
                authority of the Bengali papers ; on the other
                | side, it would have been only fair to Mr. Keir
                | Hardie to have waited for confirmation of these
                reports before sending a telegram which he
                | must have known would greatly agitate opinion
                tin England. . : . This illustrates our point of
                ' Saturday that Reuter’s cotrespondent showed
                ‘ himself a good advocate, but a bad reporter.
                ' He can please himself whether he believe’ Mr.
                | Hardie or not, but he must also have the good-
                ness to‘let other people’ have a chance of pleas-
                ‘ing themselves too ; and his business was to
                report what Mr. Keir Hardie himself said he
                | said, especially as he had got Mr. Hardie into
                trouble by reporting pret other people said
                he said.”</p>

                <p>Our readers will; we.think, be better able
                to ‘understand and appreciate this great ce-
                remony if we give afew interesting particulars
                connected with its history. To begin with,
                London’s “Roll of Fame,” as all know, dates
                back from ancient times, but our purpose will
                be, served if we confine our selection therefrom
                within the past century or so. The first name.
                that comes to our notice is that,of his Royal
                Highness the Prince Regent, afterwards George
                the Fourth, Then, later in 1840, the much 
                lamented Prince Consort became the recipient 
                of the honour, and in course of time his Royal 
                Highness’s four sons, the Prince.of Wales, now 
                our Gracious King Edward the Seventh, the 
                Duke of Edinburgh, the Duke of Connaught, and 
                the late Duke of Albany took up their freedom
                by patrimony—that is, on attaining their
                majority they exercised their right to be
                énrolled as-the sons of a Freeman; their cousin,
                the Duke of Cambridgeraleo having done so in
                1857. The names which next come to our
                notice are those of great warriors, Lord Nelson,
                Captain Thomas Hardy, Vice-Admiral Lord
                Collingwood, The Duke of Wellington, Lord
                Napier of Magdala, Lord Wolseley, and Lord
                Kitchener. Of famous statesmen we find the
                names of William Pitt, afterwards Earl of
                Chatbam, and in 1784 that of his son the Rt.
                Hon, William Pitt, who at the age of
                24 had been installed as Premier and Chan-

                <p>An interesting episode is connected with the,
                conferment of the honour upon Lord Nelsoti,
                After the victorious ending of the Battle of the
                Nile, Admiral Nelson forwarded to the. Lord
                Mayor of London the sword surrendered by
                the Commanding French Admiral Blanquet,
                with a letter in which he said that, having the
                honour of being a Freeman of the City of Lon-
                don, he offered the sword to the Lord Mayor,
                and requested that the City would honour him
                by accepting it, “‘as a remembrance that Bri-
                tannia still rules the waves”, adding “which
                thatshe. may ever do is the prayer of your
                lordship’s most obedientservant, Horatio Nel-
                son.” The letter is addressed from “Vangoard”,
                Mouth of the Nile, August 8th, 1798.</p>
                <p>There are four methods by which the Free-
                dom can be acquired (1) by patrimony ; the 
                sons of Freemen being entitled, on attaining
                their majority, to be enrolled as a matter of
                right ; (2) by apprentieeship to a master who
                is ‘already a aan: (3) by purchase ; and
                (4) by gift conferrered by the Corporation, hon-
                oris causa, This latter is only granted in
                recognition of very distinguished ,public servi-
                ces. ‘The bestowment of the Freedom is still
                carried ont according to ancient ceremonial,
                although this is somewhat modified in the
                case of ordinary admissions. Six citizens,
                usually selected from the Chairmen of Com-
                mittees éf the Corporation, give -their testi-
                mony to the fitness of the person about to
                be honoured with the Freedom, stating that
                he is “a man of good name and fame; that 
                he does not desire the Freedom of this City
                whereby to defraud the,King or this City of
                their rights, customs, or advantages, but that
                he will pay his scot and bear his. lot; and
                so they all say."</p>
                <p>A few facts concerning the Court of Com-
                mon Council, which has the exclusive right
                of conferring the honorary’ Freedom of the
                City may not be inappropriate. The Coun-
                cil consists of 206 members, and shares with
                the Court of Aldermen, which numbers 26
                members, the responsibility, under the Lord
                Mayor, of the government of the City of 
                London.</p>
                <p>The Court is entrusted with the manage-
                ment of the finances and estates of the Cor-
                poration, .glects most of the officials, and
                controls the police. The City also elects a
                Sheriff of Middlesex as well as of London, and
                the Lord Mayor is elected by the Trade Guilds
                in Common Hall from among the Aldermen
                who have served as Sheriffs.</p>
                <p>The Court of Aldermen is of very ancient
                origin, the first mention of such a Court being
                found in‘an ancient chronicle, where the writer
                —himself an Alderman—says; lp the year</p>
                
                <p>1200 were chosen fiye and twenty of the more</p>
                <p>- discreet men of the City, and sworn to take</p>
                <p>counsel on behalf of the City, together with
                the Mayor.”</p>
                <p>The City appears to have been governed by
                the Court of Aldermen before the Common
                Council was-in existance. The earliest known
                list of members of this Council is found in the
                City Archives about the date 1285. </p>
                <p>The Guildhall, where this very interesting
                ceremony takes place to-day, is one of London's
                most ancient and histotic buildings, It still
                retains the greater part of the old building
                which was damaged in the great fire of London
                in 1666, and was rebuilt by Dance in 1798.</p>
                <p>The resolution that the Freedom be conferred
                upon Lord Cromer was passed at a meeting of
                the Cort of Common Council held on the 31st
                of May last, and was in the following terins :—</p>
                <p>“Resolved that the Freedom of the City in
                a snitable gold box be presented to the Hon.
                Evelyn Baring, Earl of Cromer G.C:B, O.M.,
                K.C.8.L, C.LE., in recognition of the long
                avd eminent public services he has rendered to
                bis country, and more especially for the dis-
                tinguished talent. and indomitable energy he
                has displayed in the discharge during nearly a
                quarter of a centary’ of thé important and
                onerous duties which have devolved upon him
                os the represntative of the British Goveroment
                in the ancient and historic land of Egypt”. .</p>
                <p>This was moved by Mr; J. W. Domoney,
                Chief Commoner, and Chairman of the City
                Lands Committee, who paid a warm tribute to
                the work carried out by Lord Cromer. He said
                that the services rendered by Lord Cromer
                during his twenty-five years’ labours in Egypt
                were ‘quite outside ordinary circumstances, and
                deserved the greatest recoguition that could be
                béstowed. It was twenty-five years since Sir</p>
                <p>Evelyn Baring went to Egypt. On his arrival</p>
                <p>he found.the place in a great «state of chaos,
                when he left it its administration and poliey—</p>
                <p>owing to his wise’ and admirable work—were
                secure and lasting. His straightforward dealing
                and impartiality in. all his relations with the
                natives accounted for his cnormovs influence</p>
                <p>over them.
                Sir George Faudel-Phillips, in seconding the</p>
                <p>resolution, said Lord Cromer would go down</p>
                <p>to history as one of our great pro-consuls,
                ranking with such men as Lord Clive. He was
                not born to greatness, but he was aman who,
                having great opportunities, made great epochs
                in our national history. There was nothing
                which could redound to the interest of. this
                great Empire and add more to its reputation and
                glory than whathad been done in Egypt. Instead
                of that country being, as it now is, amongst
                the most civilised parts of the- globe, it was
                not too much to say that it would be in the
                hands of ignorant and despotic rulers, with the
                result that the trouble to Europe would be
                irreparable. Lord Cromer had won the con-
                fidence of men whose only previous’ expe-</p>
                <p>‘riences @f government were a tradition, and</p>
                <p>knowledge of. cruelty and. oppression which
                terrified them—he had first won their confi-
                denee and then their goodwill. They werd}
                voting that day to one of their greatest liv:
                ing statesmen the greatest honour they pos-
                sessed, and the Corporation, in so doing,
                was honouring a man who had done wonder-

                <p>sie KAMEL’S PATRIOTISM.</p>
                <p>(From a CorRESPO N DENT)</p>
                <p>There is something superb in the spectacle</p>
                <p>of a dying soldier who, while knowing that his:</p>
                <p>last hope is dead still faces his foe with</p>
                <p>unmoved calm, quietly and persistently parry- |</p>
                <p>ing such attacks as he is able, until at last the |
                fatal thrust reachés him, and he falls a martyr
                to his country, leaving a name to be honoured</p>
                <p>‘even by the opposing. forces which took his] j</p>
                <p>life. But let us imagine that daring the mom-
                ents of his last stand, he had filled the
                with the sound of vain- -glorious. boasting, with
                a ceaseless song of self praise “behold me I
                diea martyr to the country which ‘I love so
                well, through all the ages shall my name be]
                cherished as that of the noblest martyr, the
                most wonderful patriot ‘that the world
                has ever known”: such a man would still
                merit ‘the praise of his country inasmuch
                as he: had died in her service though -it
                is possible that such praise would be not
                unmixed with contempt. Let us sup
                that a man whom the world had long since
                ceased to take seriously, whose power, iff he
                was really ever possessed with any, had de</p>
                <p>ed, let us picture him as striving for the adu
                ation of the people.He rises upand with feve
                expressions | of patriotism and zeal proclai
                himself the chosen leader of his country, pie-
                tures in viyid langoagethe terrors of a vile and

                and to tarn to himas the only being on earth

                sense of pity for.a mistaken brother who is
                making himself supremely ridiculous.</p>
                <p>- But this is all by the way. I had intended
                writing of the great speech, made by our great
                “ Director” on the twenty-second day. -of
                October, i in the year of our Lord one thousand</p>
                <p>nine hundred and seven.
                ““Qur Director” was great, there can be no</p>
                <p>doubt as to that, and from the tangled mass of:</p>
                <p>controversy which fell from. his august lips I
                gather the knowledge that; half blinded by the
                spirit of true patriotism though he -may be,
                his vision is still sufficiently clear to enable
                him to see and appreciate his own greatness,
                equally with the lesser mortals who look up to
                him with veneration from the street. Some
                have even gone as far as to suggest that he is
                of more importance in his own eyes than he is
                in the eyes of others, but this is no isolated
                instance of where the ignorance of the common</p>
                <p>herd has robbed genius of immediate re-</p>
                <p>cognition.
                The details of his speech are by this time</p>
                <p>familiar to all. Every one who could read, rich
                and poor, lowly and great, expended his half
                piastre and secured, through the medium of the
                press, the priceless utterances of a great man.
                Indeed it is safe to assert that such was thestir
                causedby the great event, that even Panch” in
                the brightest days ofits zenith, was never read
                with more avidity than was the great organ of
                ‘the National movement yesterday. “Garlands
                of flowers” we read, were presented to the great
                man at the conclusion of his wonderful eff rt.
                Even Gladstone in all his glory never a
                to this, but here is an orator who has ascend
                with one bound to tho giddy heights of fam
                hitherto sacred to an Edna May or Phyllis Dar</p>
                <p>It is a pleasant suggestion truly that halfa
                life mis.spent entitles aman to perfecthappiness
                for the remainder of his days, and this at least
                is the inference I draw from the remarks anent
                ‘the centuries which “our Director” accuses the
                Egyptians of havingwasted. He asserts that by
                reason of these mis-spent centuries Egypt is
                now entitled to immediate and prolonged
                happiness. May the happiness be both im-
                mediate and prolonged, Director, but forgive
                me if I cannot quite follow your argument.</p>
                <p>It is certainly most annoying when one has
                spent both time and money (no matter whose)
                in the making of a party which is destined’ in</p>
                <p>the minds of its promoters to become the re- |.</p>

                should by every tenet of right considér them-
                selves oppressed ; it is more than annoying, it
                is heart-rending, -to find the chosen legion of
                the oppressed refusing point, blank to act in
                the roll allotted to them, and’ accusing the
                month-piece of uttering false echos ; therefore
                one is not surprised to find that the “Director”
                should wax indignant, and reiterate his appeal
                that there should be but one party—his own—</p>
                <p>and but one leader —himself.
                And why should the fortune hunting English</p>

                subsequently recommended by his Department 
                to the British Government for service with a

                The whole party was ultimately, attacked by a |i
                severe form of scurvey, and it was mainly due
                to the pluck, skill, and endurance displayed by
