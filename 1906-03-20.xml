                        per cent, on returning within 12 months.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the above regular weekly service there are sailings about twice a
                        fortnight of 5,000 to 7,000 tons steamers to London, calling at Malta or

                    <p>The Mail Steamers leave Suez for Aden and Bombay every Wednesday, and for
                        Australia and China every alternate Wednesday. A steamer leaves for Calcutta,

                        <p>Mr. Congal Wangh, reporting on the trade at
                                Constantinople, mentions that last summer he visited, at the
                                suggestion of the Board of Trade, the Chambers of Commerce of
                                Sheffield, Bradford, and Manchester, with a view to finding what
                                kind of information manufacturers and merchants look for in Consular
                                trade reporta, and in what other respects Consular assistance can
                                promote British trade.
                        </p>
                        <p>In his report, just published, Mr. Waugh shows his willingness to forward
                            British trade interests in many ways that other Consuls disdain. He
                            states, for instance, that while it is outside any Consal's power to sue
                            for a trader's debts, there are various ways in which an official
                            persuasion or pressure can be brought to bear upon debtors, and whenever
                            possible this is done. If this fails, he recommends a lawyer who can
                            take legal proceedings, and by treaty the Consulate has the official
                            right to watch lawsuits undertaken by British subjects before the
                            Turkish courts. Mr. Waagh, in fact, invites inquiries on such questions,
                            as well as on the advisability of giving credit, and on the employ. ment
                            of competent agente. Moreover, be has sent daring the year confidential
                            communications to firms interested in special trades.</p>
                        <p>If other Consuls adopt this sympathetic attitude to British traders a
                            revolution would gradually be wrought in the Congalar service. It is
                            clear that the Foreign Office places no obstacles in the way, but, on
                            the other hand, Mr. Wangh's report shows that everything depends on the
                            Consul himself. It is noticeable that Mr. Waugh again emphasizes the im.
                            portance of British manufacturers sending out efficient travellers, of
                            our total import trade into Turkey in 1904 no less than 64 per cent.
                            consisted of cotton piece-goods and yarns, and in some measure this is
                            due to the Armenian and Greek houses established in Manchesterwhich is
                            testimony to the economic value of at least one section of our alien
                            population. Bat German and Italian rivals are persevering and a warning
                            is given. Great Britain still does nearly twice as much trade with
                            Turkey as any other country, but in the last quinquennium our exports
                            increased only 33 per cent., whilo German exports increased 130 per
                            cent.</p>

                        <p>The Khedive with an escort of the bodyguard arrived at 4 p.m. accompanied
                            by reversal of the Palace officials and way received by Bigbos Pacha
                            Nabar, M.Galvin, and Mr. Astley Hriend, who conducted his Highness to
                            the building in which the rew mechanical installation is oont i el.
                            After examining the plans and diagrams explaining nature and the
                            construo. tion of the arte-ian wells the Khedive descended to inspect
                            the machinery, which w89 Bet in motion, and afterwards visited other
                            parts of the works.</p>
                        <p>The Khedive showed great interest in all that he saw and referred to his
                            visit in most complimentary terms on taking leave of Mr. Friend about 5
                            p.m. A well-stocked buffet under the care of Mr. Wild, of the Savoy
                            Hotel, was well patronised and admirably managed. </p>
                        <p>The water supplied by the now walls is clear and free from all smell or
                            color. It is absolutely sterile, no trace whutever of bacterial life
                            being found in it, and harder than Nile water.</p>
                        <p>During the flood season it is twice as haid but this difference decreases
                            during the f»ll till in May the difference in the hydrotimetria figure
                            of the two waters is reduced to the proportion of 7:3. </p>
                        <p>The well water contains a relatively large quantity of bicarbonate of
                            chalk and magnesia bat is far freer of Valproic acid than Nile water. In
                            quality it differs in no way from the water with which the chief cities
                            of England, France, and Germany are supplied. The proportion of salt
                            discovered in Nile water by chemical analysis at the season of low flood
                            is about 2 times as great as that found to be present in the wells. </p>
                        <p>The water now supplied by the new installation has no doubt the same
                            origin as the river. water,i.e.,is Nile water that is filtered through
                            the soil. But this filtration h38 not taken place anywhere in the
                            immediate neighbourhood of the wells, as is proved both by chemical
                            analysis and by the constant temperature of the well water, which has
                            clearly travelled for a great distance through the lower strata of the
                            soil. Dr. Bitter, in a note to which we are indebted for the above
                            information, states his belief that the wells are fed by the under:
                            ground Nile, that subterranean stream which below the surface
                            accompanies the great river and has the same origin.</p>
                        <p>The Arabs frequently fail to distinguish by taste between the well water
                            and the Nile, &amp; strong testimony to its pleasantness for drinking
                            purpose, while the depth from which it is drawn guards it from all risk
                            of contamination, For three years past two of the twelve wells sunk bue
                            been aged day and night but the chemical composition of the water drawn
                            from these and fion the other ten has shown po appreciable

                            Constantinople. In quite &amp; number of instances the Grand Turk has
                            gone out of his way to put affront on England in particular, hard as he
                            has nothing to gain from that perversity it has come to be suspected on

                            largest stupidity to touch even the fringe of the Eastern Question.
                            Austria Hungary stands in much the same position ; while France and

                            to justify belief that the Ka'ber is the mani. polator of Ottoman policy
                            There was the late mysterious trespass of Turkish troops on E yptian
                            territory ; here was the claim pat forward the other dry by semi-

                            influence in Abyssinia ; in Persia the Sultan has become curiously

                        <p>Mr. Atkins : The defendants in this case would wish to take the
                            construction of the written contract to the Court of Appeal, andl apk
                            for the usual stay open thạir bringing the money into Court.</p>
                        <p>His Lordship : I am not going to grant a stay of execution. You can take
                            the contract into the Court of Appeal if you like.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Atkins : There will be judgment for the defendants on the
                            counterclaim for £100 and costs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Duke: Such costs as they are entitled to. </p>
                        <p>His Lordship : Yes</p>
                        <p>Later in the day Mr. J. R. Atkin applied to the Court of Appeal, on
                            behalf of Messrs. Bewick Moreing and Co., for &amp; stay of execution.
                            Counsel stated that the case turned on the construction of a written
                            contract, and there was a claim for commission. The question of
                            construction was really left to the jury, although it was submitted, on
                            behalf of the defendants, that it was a question for the learned Judge.
                            The jury returned &amp; verdict for the plaintiff for £725. He (counsel)
                            now applied "ex parte" for a stay of execution until Monday next, for
                            which day he would serve notice of motion on the other side.</p>
                        <p>Their Lordships granted the application.</p>
                        <p>On Monday, last week, the appeal was heard before Lords Justices Vaughan,
                            Williams, Stirling, and Fletcher Moulton.</p>
                        <p>Mr. J. R. Atkin, in support of the application, said his clients were
                            prepared to bring the amount of the verdict into Court at once as a term
                            of the stay. The defender ts wished to take the opinion of the Court of
                            Appeal on the question of construction of the agreement, which was a
                            point of some difficulty.</p>
                        <p>In the result, the application was a journal for the attendance of Mr.
                            Duke, K.C, on behalf of the plaintiff.</p>

                        <head>INTERESTING MEETING IN CAIRO.</head>
                        <p>Unfortunately Prebɔndary Carlile's visit to Cairo has been such a short
                            one that he had no time to give fall prominence to the announcement of
                            his very interesting though short meeting at the Continental Hotel
                            yesterday afternoon. It was also unfortunate that be bad to fix this
                            date irrespective of the other functions that were held that afternoon,
                            whereby his audience was robbed of the presence of both Lord Cromer and
                            Sir Reginald Wingate, both of whom wrote expressing their regret at pot
                            being able to be present, and enclosing at the same time donations to
                            the good of the cause. </p>
                        <p>As was to be expected, the man, who has given his life to the cause of
                            the outcast and the needy, proves a very magnetic personality, and while
                            listening to his simple direct statements one can form &amp; very good
                            idea of the reason of his success. He has spent bat &amp; week in Cairo,
                            but one of his first actions was to pay a visit to the Reformatory for
                            boys which is situated at Gizeh, and which is conducted on such
                            admirable lines. His energetic mind saw at once the drawback of an
                            institution which does its level best for its inmates and yet is unable
                            to cope with the difficulties which surround them when they once leave
                            its walls. His suggestion was practical enough, and one hopes that in
                            time it will be possible to follow his idea and start in Cairo a Labour
                            Home, where it is possible for men and youths to regain their characters
                            and to make a fresh start in life. </p>
                        <p>The description of the work done under the organisation of Prebendary
                            Carlile in England is interesting to &amp; degree. The enormous extent
                            of his working is almost incredible, for not only has he his labour
                            homes, King's Tents, and other institutions in London, but he is
                            constantly finding fresh openings for likely characters in the far North
                            West of Canada, and also is always ready to provide labour wherever it
                            is required in England. The magnificent donation of £1,000 which the
                            Queen sent him this last winter had not been in his possession
                            twenty-four hours before a well-thought-out scheme was in action for the
                            relief of ihr reedy unemployed in Londonthose who had wife and children
                            dependent on them. No believer in encouraging mendacity, the Prebendary
                            has started a system whereby a man must give a certain amount of work in
                            return for his relief, and though he acknowledges that his system is by
                            no means &amp; remedy for the federal poverty of the submerged tooth,
                            still it is a far more solitary way out of the difficulty than
                            indiscriminate charity. Prebendary Carlile spoke of his muy difficulties
                            and also enthusiastically of the many kind friends who fathered his
                            projects and assisted him not only with bandsome donations, but also
                            with very welcome personal assistance. He also spoke of his church, St.
                            Mary's-at-Hill, and of his popular services there, and the attractions
                            he held out to his congregation. The orchestra of string and wind
                            instruments is one of the great elements in his service. As one old
                            gentleman remarked to him, "It do make my headache, but it do my heart
                            good.” Another old lady complimented him with the remark, Since me
                            husband has been to your show church,-he don't Want to go to no music
                            halls,”—which was perhaps the highest appreciation they could offer. </p>
                        <p>Time forbids any longer account of this most interesting subject, and it
                            is to be much regretted tbąt there will be no further opportunity of
                            hearing more of the wonderful work which is the outcome of one man's
                            sympathy for the poor and needy. That sympathy which is always ready to
                            assist those who have had no chance in life, and which is ready again
                            and again to help on the fallen and to place their feet once more in the
                            right way. One is glad to think that the great ones of the world value
                            Prebendary Cariile's work as it should be valued, and one trusts that
                            his short visit to Cairo will result in a furtherance of his great life
                            task.</p>
