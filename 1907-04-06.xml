                        proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent
                        Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to

                        Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                        Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                        begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                        Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                        scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                        in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                        <head>Allenburys' DIET</head>
                        <p>The "Allenburys" DIET is a complete milk and farinaceous Food, easy of
                            assimilation, most agreeable to take, simply and quickly made. It is
                            recommended in place of ordinary milk foods, gruel, etc., and whilst
                            acceptable to all as a light nourishment, it is particularly helpful to
                            Dyspeptics, Invalids and the Aged. In the sick-room it will be found
                            invaluable and it is easily and quickly made, the addition of boiling water
                            only being necessary. </p>
                        <p>The "Allenburys" DIET is readily digested by tose who are unable to take
                            cow's milk and is particularly serviceable in convalescence. When taken as a
                            light supper diet it will be found to promote tranquil and refreshing sleep.
                            Although this DIET is a good for ADULTS and is entirely distinct fom the
                            "Allenburys" Foods for Infants, yet it is also of great value as a
                            restorative food for young children, especially during convalescence. </p>

                            LORD MILNER AND THE NATION.
                            "No one has so proper a right to give a lead in national organisation as Lord Milner" says the "Globe". At a time when the Empire was enduring the greatest crisis it had known for at least a hundred years, he was regularly communicating with his fellow Pro Consuls in every part of the Empire. The experience and conviction of many years, spent partly at the periphery, partly at the hub | of the Empire, appear in his remarkable son tribution to the "National Review," which should become the "locus classicus" for the creed he dolares. It is the natural development of the nation that it should produce !
                            Australia, in the little islands in great ocean
                            well in the continental colonies Civis Britannicus sum," is as proud pasaport now as ever was the Roman boast. But this loyalty demands representation. The greater the divergence of the separate nations that compose the great nation, the greater the desire and need of some constitutional nucleus where the calls of wider external policy may be discussed. The expression of the nation's power is the Navy; and in the distribution of the Navy all parts of the Empire should have at least . consultative Voice Call this new thing in the Constitution Council or Conference, or what you will, it must be real, it must be dissociated from Downing street or any one spot in any island or continent, it must be genuinely representative, and it must meet frequently. Such is the kind of Lord Milner's message, expressing with a tine and, as it were, impersonal al truths to which only excess of prejudice or deficiency of patriotism can blind the public.
                            THE RUMANIAN RIOTS. In spite of the change of Government at Bucharest, and the soothing official reports as to the lessening of the disturbances, which have been sent over Europe, it seems perfectly plain that the Rumanian riots are getting worse instead of better. An army of peasants, to the number of several thousands, is marching on Bucharest, and the Army has order to fire on them if they do not disperse before they reach the capital. The situation much resembles that at the commencement of Richard II. reign, when the peasants marched on London, their grief. ances apparently being very similar to those advanced by the Rumanian peasants. The present rising will no doubt and in much the same way, but meanwhile the change of Ministry must have tended to paralyse the Government. However, Mr. Stourdza, the new Liberal Premier, is an old Parliamentary hand, and three of his colleagues have also held office before. It is very unfortunate that public opinion should have necessitated * change of Ministry at this crisis, but that is one of the weaknesses of popular government, and the authorities will have to do the best they can without having really been able to grasp more than the salient facts of the situation. So threatening has the state of stairs become that the landowners have had to ask the Government for protection for themselves and property. The number of troops is hardly sufficient to quell the rioters, and there is also the danger that those peasants who have only recently been called to the Colours may get out of band and make common case with the drifters There is no doubt much distress in any districts among the peasantry, but in a rich country like Rumanis, with a population by no means overcrowded, much of that poverty is essed by the primitive methods of agriculture

                    <head>(From our correspondent)</head>
                    <p>Port Said, Friday. Coaling operations yesterday were conducted chiefly by the ships own crews and in all such cases the work has been slow, but the strikers have not interfered in any way. The Orient Mail Steamer Ormuz was the only case where any trouble arose. A very clever ruse was exercised by the agents of this steamer. On the starboard side, (exposed to the shore) a gang of men from the ship were engaged shipping the bunkers, but on the opposite side &amp; small gang of Arabs had been enlisted presumably under the promise of extra pay; doubt. less these men were only too willing to work inasmuch as their demands were being met as far as that steamer was concerned.

                    <p>As was announced a few days since, the dance on Thursday at Ghezireh Palace Hotel was the last of a series which have been among the most chic and brilliant functions of the season. Even though many of the most popular visitors have already taken their departure there were a goodly numb or left to take part in this last festivity and though many preferred to spend their evening quietly sitting on the verandahs and in the gardens, the greater proportion kept the orchestra busy till clase on two o'clock. Lady Vivian was among the most energetic of dancers during the earlier part of the evening; she was wearing a very pretty frock of the semi-Empire persuasion in grey net with clusters of pink roses in her hair and corsage. Nearly all the prettiest dresses were of this popular semi. Empire form with the elevated waist line which is becoming graceful figures. That worn by Mrs. Park Lyle was quite lovely - soft muslin scattered all over with golden sequins, narrow rouleaux of satin, and gold embroideries confining the corsage and wei_hting the skirt. Mrs Rigden's frock of white chiffon bore handsome sorolls of rouleaux about the skirt, and the pink sash was caught up high between the shoulders. Miss Bennett, too, wore a lovely little frock of white net and and fine lace, the sleeves being of the modish kimono tasbion, and Miss Leverich's pretty frock of soft muslin also hung from an elevated waist line. Mrs. Rom was wearing a gorgeous gown of grey green satin,, with &amp; very full Bursage confined by a handsome yoke of dull gold embroidery, and M18. Barrow looked wonderfully well in black velvet with a shaped berthe of lace embroidered with gold Mrs. Morgan was also in black with some fine lace about the bodice, and Miss Bullook, too, was in the same colour. It was Mme Heller I believe who was wearing the lovely frock of pale blue eloth souple trimmed with tiny ruchings and &amp; waistband embroidered with rosebuds. Miss Tuck's pretty white chiffon frock had a deep pointed bibot Irish lace; and the same handsome dentelle was worn by Miss Makeller on a frock of yellow chiffon. Miss Mitchell, who came with Col. and Mrs. Gordon, was in cream satin, 1 a few crimson roses tucked into her corsage, and Miss Duffin was wearing a handsome frock of deep rose with a folsled corsage and sleeves inserted with lace and bands of satin à la japonaise. Mrs. Wilding bad on a frock of purple with pink roses in her hair and a large cluster of the same in her bodice: Miss Duke was in pink satin and Miss Mo was wearing a truck of much the same colour, Miss Er-kine Shaw's fresh and dainty frock way of white net trimmed wib pink satin ribbon and worn over pale pink. Miss Wanklyn, who with her sister aud Mrs. F. W Saunders have just arrived from Upper Egypt, was wearing a pretty soft frock of blue, while her younger sister was in white. The Misses York were also wearing blue lovely frocks of tissue with trails of chiffon flowers of the same colour, and Miss Fieldan toà was in blue, the transparent yoke of the corsage being embroidered with many roses and finished in front will be a large pink rose. The Misses Morcom were also present, as were Miss Miles, Miss Joseph and Miss Gearon, Mrs No. lan, Mrs Charlton, Mrs Peach, and many others who have done their share to make the season the success it has been.</p>

                        Popular as the meetings of the Alexandria Amateur Athletic Club always are, that of yesterday, the 33rd annual meeting, proved more successful and popular than any of its predecessors, for an extra interest and grace was lent to the occasion by the presence of our Royal visitors, and magnificently did the club rise to the great occasion. The grounds of the A. S C. were gaily decorated with bunting, the stands were crowded with interested spectators, and thanks to the energy of the committee, everything went off without &amp; hitch. The weather was not so propitious as it might have been, for a hot, dry khamsin wind was blowing, though, perhaps this was preferable to the chilly winds that have prevailed of late.
                        The sports commenced at 1 30 p.m. and several of the events came off before the arrival of the Royal party at about a quarter to five.

Their Royal Highnesses were received by the committee, the members of which were presented by Mr. E. B. Gould, and they then proceeded to the Khedivial stand specially decorated for the occasion, from where they could get a good view of the several events.
                        Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Con. naught, the Princess Patricia and Lady Cramer were then presented with bouquets by the Misses Ryth Haselden, May Thomas and Phyllis Jones. Tea was partaken of by the Royal party in a special marquee which Mrs. Gould and Mrs. F Haselden had kindly provided. | T.R.H. took a great interest in the sports, the Duke coming down to the course to follow the tugs of war and subsequent events more
                        closely.
                        The attendance was very large, perhaps more numerous than at any previous meeting, and towards five o'clock the Club stands were packed. All Alexandria seemed to have turned out for the occasion. preferable to the chilly winds that have prevailed of late.

                        Within a quarter of an hour of the arrival of the train the Royal party, preceded by an ! escort af Military Mounted Police, drove into the grounds of the Sporting Club to the strains of "God Save the King," played by the Don Bosco band, which performed throughout the afternoon. Their Royal Highnesses were received by the committee, the members of which were presented by Mr. E. B. Gould, and they then proceeded to the Khedivial stand, specially decorated for the occasion, from where they could get a good view of the several events. |Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Con. naught, the Princess Patricia and Lady Cromer were then presented with bouquets by the Misses Ryth Haselden, May Thomas and Phyllis Jones. Tea was partaken of by the Royal party in a special marquee which Mrs. Gould and Mrs. F Haselden had kindly provided. | T.R.H. took a great interest in the sports, the Duke coming down to the course to follow the tugs of war and subsequent events more
                        closely.
                        The attendance was very large, perhaps more numerous than at any previous meeting, and towards five o'clock the Club stands were packed. All Alexandria seemed to have turned out for the occasion.
                        Several ladies and gentlemen, who were at the sports had the honour of being presented to their Royal Highnesses.
                        The prizes were most graciously distributed to the winners by the Duchess, Messrs. P. W. Carver and R. L. Barnard assisting. At the close of the distribution Mr E.B. Gould called for three cheers for the Duke and Duchess, which was most heartily responded to by the crowd. T.RH. then returned to the marquee, and at G.10 p.m., after shaking hands with the members of the Committee, and several other ladies and gentlemen standing on the course, drove off to Sidi Gaber Station.
                        Great credit is dye to the members of the Committee, to whose careful arrangements and personal efforts much of the success which attended this 33rd meeting must be attributed. We wish particularly to mention Mr. Frank Haselden who e services were invaluable in getting the course in order.

                        Malgré les meilleures indications d'Europe et d'Alexandrie tous ensemble, notre marché des valeurs est resté, ce matin, paralyse durant une bonne partie de la créance. Certes, la peur ne hante plus les esprits comme ces jours der niers ; on se montre plus rassuré, mais on n'en persiste pas moins dans l'indécision et dans la réserve. On a l'air de se demander si cette dépression presque ininterrompue est vraiment appelée à prendre fin, et l'on perd ainsi, malheureusement, de vae que tout nouveau recul de la route, amené par la latitude laissée au parti baissier, a pour effet de découvrir d'anciennes positions à la hausse et pour conséquence la vente forces de ces positions.

B lisant certains articles alarmants publiés à Londres aussi bien qos Paris, &amp; Berlin, à Bruxelles et ailleurs, on pouvait croire aisément, en effet, qu'il y avait danger de graves perturbations sur les bords du Nil, ce qui n'était pas fait pour inspirer confiance aux capitaux européens.

                    <p>The annual general meeting of the above Company was held at 4 p.m. on Saturday March 30th. at the Company's offices in Cairo.
                        HE. Hassan Pasha Assem, the Chairman of the Board, presiding.
                        The notice convening the meeting having been read, the Chairman said :
                        "In presenting their first annual report pour Board has to regret the absence from the meeting to day of the Chairman Sir William Willcocks. As you are doubtless Aware he was attacked by fever whilst travelling in Uganda and has been unable to return to Egypt for this meeting as he had hoped to do. I am glad to say that the latest news states he is improving rapidly,
                        Since the formation of the Company two properties have been acquired in Lower Egypt at Bastara and at Manchieh El Ibrahimieh both in the province of Behera.
                        Bastara Property - 1505f7k 168 were acquired in all at a cost of LB. 103,254,629 about L.E. 68 per feddan, A capital expenditure of L.E. 4.288 183 has been made on the property comprised as follows: New Canals, drains and roads LE. 3,079.184 Managers house, cattle sta
                        bles, ezbase. Installation of a pump and
                        flour mill. Destruction of old banks, etc., and Kassabia work.

                        735

                        L.E. 4.288.183 giving a total cost per feddan of about LE 71}.
                        The system of irrigation and communications made by the former owner was adopted and developed. The property to day is divided by these works into suitable and well defined blocks for sale anil minor canals and drainage channels ensure a rapid amelioration of the land and admit sales of plots of any size suitable to large or small purchasers, TE
                        The sales up to December 31st amounted to 85.15.14 for LE. 10892.789. As our report states, this is equivalent to a price per feddan over LE. 120. The sale price shews a profit of 25% on the initial outlay. The sum of LE. 867,834 in the balance sheet shews the proht on the amount of capital actually encashed; credit for the remainder of the profit will be taken as the annual instalments are paid: The ezbas built on the properties last year are now full, the rents have largely increased and demands to buy plots at advantageous prices are continually being made.
                        Permission to erect a pump to lift drainage water into the government drain has been granted by the Irrigation department, and a pump and corn mill is being installed. The drainage in 1906 was all by free flow, but the possession of a pump ensures continual drainage if at any time the government drain should be unusually high.

Three horse tambours and one steam tambour have been installed to lift drainage when necessary but the rotations on the Government drains have given free flow to drainage water almost continua ly during flood time. Two new ezbase have been built for LE 576, and L.E.800 approximately has been spent in kassees work and levelling old banks. The Property to-day represents a total capital value of LE 68361.847 equal to a cost per feddan of LE 58 approximately. The Irrigation Department have completely remodelled the Telmeh Canal which traverses the property, and a greatly improved water supply will result. No land has been sold

                    The Board is prepared to increase their agricultural holdings in Egypt, but with the greatly increased price even of undeveloped land it is very difficult to acquire properties that assures safe and immediate profit. Although the statutes would enable the Company to deal in building lands none have been acquired, as in Cairo and Alexandria, as well as the smaller towns and villages of Egypt the speculation in building land has developed in the last year to such a degree that the directors have not thought it advisable to buy building land.
                    In accordance with the decision of the extraordinary general meeting held last March, your Board decided to extend the operations of the Company to Cyprus, and the Chairman of the Board was empowered to treat with the Government of the island for an Agricultural Bank concession and to acquire properties in the island on behalf of the Company. The broad lines of the bank concession are detailed in the annual report and the Company has had the good fortune to acquire the services of Mr. B. G mirayan to undertake the management of the bank. This gentleman has been an official in various government departments for a great number of years and his experience and thorough knowledge of the island will be of the greatest service in developing this portion of our work.
                    Four long loans L.E. 1755 have been made at 8% ; there are 200 long loans at 9%. The short loans have been made to groups of villagers each of whom is responsible for his own loan and that of his associates, careful enquiry is made of the solvability of these men before the loan is ratified.
                    The absence of a land tax in specie makes it impossible for the bank to calculate the amount that can be advanced on a property according to the fixed government tax as has been done on broad lines in this country : in Cyprus the securities offered are carefully examined in detail with the aid of the govern ment officials and a general examination of the registered sales of land is being initiated which will form an accurate and valuable guide to valuations.
                    Before leaving the subject of the agricultural bank I feel justified in stating that the government of Cyprus believe that an institution such as we are building up will largely benefit the island and we owe a debt of gratitude to the officials to whose aid and co-operation is due in a large measure its success.
                    The last return from Cyprus gives the total amount out on loan up to £23,612.
                    We now come to our land investments in Cyprus. When it was decided to acquire interests in the island your chairman undertook to study the matter, and the purchases made were negotiated and concluded by him, and furthermore voluntarily undertake the management in Cyprus during 1906 which he only relinquished shortly before Christmas. I will first turn to our Famagusta property. The development of this town was taken up by the Government within recent years. A harbour with a deep-water quay has been constructed where ships can be alongside in all weather and a railway has been made from Famagusta to Nicosia, the Capital town of Cyprus, and thence on to Morphon. Both these works were only concluded in 1905 and their presence cannot but largely increase in the near future the importance of the town and the amount of business transacted there. We have acquired an area of about 19 feddans adjoining the quay and railway , roads have been made on these lands and with a view to development of the property for building purposes.

The area of 10,000 square yards approximately, of which mention is made in the report, will be utilised in great part for the erection of stores from which the Company should ultimately obtain considerable revenue. The rest of the Famagusta land lies chiefly between the quay and the main railway station, a distance of between one and two kilometres.
                    The Company has constructed two dwelling houses for the use of the Company's representative in the Island and the manager of the Agricultural Bank. A building for the offices of the Company and of the bank, has been corrected and is now in use. A building is in the process of erection which will be in part occupied when ready by the Imperial Ottoman Bank and in part by the telegraph offices. On the other side the government is erecting new offices, lawton arts etc., for the district, of which l'amagusta is the chief town.

                    A large part of our Famagusta lands were formerly built on or laid out in gardens the old wells are being opened up and new ones made where needed, and fruit and vegetable gardens are being planted The orange and pomegranate gardens in the neighbourhood are famous for the quality of their
                    -frait and their productiviness: the water is h raised from wells by sakkies and windmills.
                    In the district between Famagusta and Nicosia we have bought 3 properties of an approximate area of 1070 ferndale. Accurate surveys are now being made of our lands.
                    Excluding farm buildings threshing floors veete, practically the whole of this area is
                    under cultivation. Part of the lands are leased 28 to peasants and part onder direct cultivation, the whole area has been manured with chemical
                    manure. The approximate price of this land rel per feddan was L.E. 11.
                    We have also acquired in this district from ot the Government an area of 3,564) feddans od which have cost us about LE 23 per feddan. ve These lands consist of reservoir sites, lands y lying below the reservoirs which were formerly
                    marshes but have been drained by the government, and are now coming under cultivation and other uncultivated lands. We were unable to take up the development of these lands in 1906 but an aren of 980 tedılans was let for
                    winter crops and it is hoped to get in a considerable area under cotton this summer e It is in one of these government lands where

                    Summer irrigation can be assured : on mnoh of our land good subsoil water exists which can be raised by means of sakkich, and windmills. The development of land by these means takes time. One may calculate that pomeyramates will hear after 3 or 4 years, oranges after five and enrouls after ten. Nearly all the land this year has been manured by chemical manure: chiefly mineral phosphate of which a large stock remains in hand. The difficulty in obtaining steam ploughs, owing to the large demand on the manufacturers bas prevented our getting as large an area under crops this winter as we should leave likely, and owing to the lateness of the antuan rains the sowing season was greatly curtailed.
                    Until the survey of our lands is complete. ted it is difficult to state the exact area of the areas cultivated But in approximate figures we have the following winter crops.
