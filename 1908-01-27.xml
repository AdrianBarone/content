                    <head>THE SEASON AT HELOUAN</head>
                    <p>Despite the fact that the season so far has Not been any means so successful
                        as that of last year, there has been a great influx of visitors during the
                        past few days, and it would seem that after all the arrival of the usual
                        numbers who yearly visit) Egypt bas been delayed rather than abandoned.
                        Helouan at least has no cause for complaint, for al the hotels are doing
                        capital business, and every day brings fresh arrivals The first dance give
                        by any of the hotels in the town was held last week at the Tewfik Palace
                        Hotel when the ball room was well filled, and the ... given last night at
                        the Grand Hotel, also attract ed many visitors. The Al Hayat, which is
                        really a town in itself while the smaller hotels of the place are also very
                        well patronized. The evident popularity of this resort might almost, we
                        would have imagined, induce the authorities to at least consider the many
                        and pressing needs of the town to which we alluded in a recent issue, but
                        perhaps the Tanzim are to be forgiven their apathy in this respect, for we
                        tremble to think of the feelings which would be expressed in Cairo should
                        the suburb of Helouan be accorded the attention which is denied to the
                        capital, and after all change is necessary to man, and as long as the
                        present order of things obtain we are not likely to be without it. For by
                        the time that one is weary of the dust, a drenching shower has converted it
                        into mud and slush Every thing changes — except the ... ence of the Tanzim
                        to the needs if the towns under its jurisdiction. A most successful dance,
                        the second one of the season, was held at the Helouan Casino on Thursday
                        evening, the hall of the Casino being well filled with dancers, many of whom
                        had jour- neyed out to Helouan from Cairo for the occasion. The hall is as
                        well suited to dancing as it is to the theatrical performances to which it
                        is usually devoted, indeed, the Casino and all its works have been an
                        assured and remark able success from the day of inauguration, and are
                        proving a boon to the inhabitants of Helouan, for the programme of
                        entertarnment ie varied and always good and the theatre hall is one of the
                        most comfortable in Cairo or its vicinity. Central by situated within a
                        minutes walk of the railway station, and within easy access of the hotels it
                        supplies a long felt want. Military band performances are given in the
                        gardens during the afternoons three times a week, while orchestral,
                        cinematograph, and theatrical performances are also given regular- ly in the
                        Casino itself. Frequent trains run to and from the Bab el Louk station in
                        Cairo, and Helouan is fast becoming what San Stefano is to Alexandria, the
                        resort of pleasure</p>

                <p>Alexandria has for the past thirty six hours heen visited by one of the most
                    violent gales ever known since meteorological observations were begun here,
                    Saturday afternoon was as time as could be wished and the sky gave no Signs of
                    the terrible weather that was impend- ing. At 7pm. the rain began to fall and in
                    half an hours time a perfect deluge of rain came down Shortly afterwards a
                    thunderbolt fell in the neighborhood of Ibrahimieh and its passage through the
                    air was extraordinarily vivid On its way earthwards it came down Like a
                    brilliant streak of flame and its fiery course was visible miles away.
                    Immediately afterwards huge crashes of thunder resounded snd the rain redoubled
                    in vigour. Throughout the night the storm showed no sign of lessening and indeed
                    grew in strength 1 the wind yesterday reached a rate of one hundred and twenty
                    kilometers the hour. The records at the Meteorological Station at Napoleon for
                    the past: twenty years slows that the wind has attained a speed of ninety to a
                    hundred kilometers per hour, But the force of the wind yesterday has never
                    during that period been equalled, Yesterday afternoon was extraordinarily
                    boisterous and the hurricane grew in violence. The rain and Wind came down in
                    powerful angry gusts and all the streets were utterly deserted. About midday
                    yesterday a hail storm of excessive severity burst over the town. The hail
                    stones came down in such quantities and were of so large a size that in a few
                    minutes the streets were covered in a mantle of white</p>

                <p>The sea was very rough and many of the hips in the harbour got adrift) and
                    dragged their anchors</p>

                <p>In the afternoon an Ottoman sailing vessel from Australia under the command of
                    Captain Macah Papalion with a cargo of wood consign ed to Rostow Bey to the
                    value of about £1,000 was driven into Eastern barbour. Drop ping her anchor in a
                    dangerous position about half past two she was only able to withstand quarter of
                    an hours bulleting Torn away From her anchorage she was driven sheer on to The
                    rocks and after a little more than two hours was a broken up wreck. The crew
                    manag ed to escape in a boat and after a hard struggle with the elements were
                    safely landed thanks to the assistance of a crew who went out to them. Last
                    night a small private tug broke away from her moorings and is now a wreck, A
                    coast guard rowing boat was dashed to pieces against the petroleum quay, and
                    several light- ers in harbour have been sunk. The wreck of the Greek brig once
                    again demonstrates the absolute necessity of a life boat service at Alex- andria
                    quays were lined with hundreds Of people who in spite of the terrible weather,
                    watched the vessel being dashed about before their eyes.</p>

                <p>The storm has uprooted great numbers of trees it the neighborhood of Alexandria,
                    About fifty trees in the Rosetta Road between Rosetta Gate and San Stefano have
                    been torn from their roots. ‘Tis an ill wind that blows nobody good and large
                    numbers of gigantic and inartistic advertisements, that have dis figured lather

                <p>The have wrought on the roofs of build ings has been considerable. A chimney on
                    the house of Mr Charles Alderson at Bulkeley was blown down and fell the roof of

                    and two Arabs buried among the ruins.</p>

                <p>They were extracted without any serious injuries. As soot the news of this

                <p>The stable of a native notable near San Stefano was struck by lightning last
                    night and a valuable horse killed</p>

                <p>A tramway car was blown right over on the Ramleh line near the Khediviah Mother's
                    Palace. Nobody was injured.</p>

                <p>Three horses were killed between the Rond Point by the Alexandria Water Company
                    pumping station and the line to Cairo. The horses were killed by a naked
                    electric wire used as a feeder for the Alexandria Tramway Company's system at
                    the Rond Point. If the pecuniary damages, which this Company has already had to
                    pay for similar accidents at this point has not already shown it the neces sity
                    of replacing this naked wire by an ander ground cable, it is strange that the
                    Municipal ity should so far have neglected its duty in not reminding the company
                    of the fact.</p>

                <p>Telegraphic communication with other parts of the country has been entirely cut
                    off by the land-lines, with the exception of a single line which can only work
                    at half its normal rate. Recourse has therefore to be had to the cables of the
                    ETC and to reach Suez it is necessary at present to circuit the continent.</p>

                        accompanied by an icy wind, in Cairo, and a steady down pour continued for
                        the whole of the forenoon. Little rain fell in the afternoon, but the cold
                        was as severe as ever, and towards nightfall a half gale sprang up, quickly
                        clearing the streets of pedestrians who were not compelled to remain abroad.
                        The cab stands were practic- ally empty, the drivers evidently preferring to
                        run the risk of losing possible fares, to the certainty of being half frozen
                        on their boxes. Despite the crowds of men and boys engaged upon the clearing
                        of mud from the principal streets, they were, as usual, almost impassible,
                        though it must be admitted that they were preferable to the pavements which
                        were carefully avoided by any but the most callous of the foot

                    <p>The Anstrian Lloyd SS. “Cleopatra,” (Captain Ivenich), which left Alexandria
                        at 4 o'clock on Saturday afternoon for Brindisi and Trieste, had to return
                        shortly afterwards owing to meeting with a mishap in the New Pass. The
                        “Cleopatra” and her captain have been on the regular express service of the
                        Austrian Lloyd between Alexandria and Trieste for years past and the Captain
                        bears a high reputation for navigation and caution As there were many ships
                        passing through the Old Pass, it was decided to take the New Pass. The pilot
                        left the steamer, as usual, before entering the Pass. The steamer when in
                        the Pass struck against a rock, which made a 1ole in her hold, number one.
                        The water rushed in with great force and filled the hold. The captain
                        decided therefore to turn back, al- hough there was no danger as the system
                        of watertight compartments acted excellently. The “Cleopatra” came back into
                        harbour at 5.30 pm and the work of discharging cargo rom No. 1 hold was at
                        once begun. The damaged cargo is as follows : two hundred bales of cotton,
                        sixteen cases of skins and seven hundred and forty two empty casks. The loss
                        s insignificant. The steamer will be taken o the dry dock at Gabbari, as
                        soon as the ‘weather improves. There were sixty-five pas- engers on board.
                        The mail was transferred to the train, which left Alexandria yesterday

                        Eldon Gorst’s visit. For the hundred yards leading to the school the four
                        hundred and fifty pupils stood on either side cheering their illustrious
                        visitor as he approached the school gate</p>
                    <p>As soon as be alighted, the Mudir introduc- ed to him Mr. H. Basta,
                        A.M.I.C.E, and Mr. S. Basta, sons of the late founder, also the headmaster.
                        Sir Eldon then in spected the school rooms asking the head- master for much
                        information concerning it, which the latter was only too pleased to answer.
                        Then a pupil delivered a speech in English which pleased Sir Eldon so mach
                        that he graciously asked the pupil to let him have it. Finally a body of
                        scholars sang “God save the King” in an admirable manner, Sir Eldon holding
                        his hat in his hand all the time. On leav- ing Sir Eldon thanked the
                        founder's sons, who take great interest in the school and support it
                        financially, also the headmaster and teachers for their conscientious
                        labours in instructing their scholars. </p>

                    <p> Among the many new companies floated last year, who are now eager to go into
                        liqui- dation, is the Egyptian Economical Residences Company, which will
                        hold an extraordinary meeting this afternoon at Cairo to consider that
                        question of the dissolution of the company. </p>
                    <p>The shareholders of the Commercial Indus- trial and Land Company of Egypt
                        Limited have been summoned to meet on the 6th Feb- ruary to consider the

                        against this policy and we beg to call the attention of our readers to a
                        notice addressed to the shareholders, which appears in our advertising

                    <head>FOR SUFFERERS FROM THE CRISIS.</head>
                    <p>In these troublous times when so many persons are suffering physically as
                        well as Financially from the crisis, it is interesting to now that a special
                        cure for persons whose nerves want calming, has been instituted in this
                        city. We are ashamed to avow that we have never beard of the “Blue Chamber”
                        here at the Paris “Figaro” vouches for it and the information has been
                        copied by many London newspapers. The following is what the “Figaro” says
                        :-</p>
                    <p>“Experiments have been made from to time to test the effect of colour on the
                        sick, especially on those suffering from nervous afflictions and mental
                        disorders. In an institution at Alex- andria, where the rooms have been
                        fitted up with coloured glass, it is found that in a blue chamber a restless
                        person has been calmed ; in red chamber a person suffering from melan-
                        holia, with a tendency to suicide, has become gay, and in a violet chamber a
                        maniac has become sane.”</p>
                    <p>The following is the text of a letter addressed to the Financial Adviser:
                        -</p>
                    <p>Sir,</p>
                    <p>With regard to the appeal which has been made to you by some of the financial
                        notabili ties of Cairo with a view to relieve the land and house owners from
                        the prejudicial effect of the crisis which has fallen on the country, I beg
                        to submit for your kind and earnest consi deration, the following remarks in
                        the interest of the mass of the people</p>
                    <p>In my opinion based on discussion with intelligent people of various classes
                        and especially with native land owners the Govern- ment ought not to
                        guarantee any loan except on the following conditions</p>
                    <p>1st. That the Credit Foncier Egyptien who is to be trusted with this work
                        should use half of the funds guaranteed by the Government and lent to him
                        for loans under one thousand pounds and over three hundred ; one quarter for
                        loans under two thousand pounds and over one thousand ; and the rest under
                        five thous- and and over two thousand</p>
                    <p>2nd. That the rate of interest charged by the credit Foncier should not be
                        over 6% in case the loan is obtained at 4% and in any case should not exceed
                        two per cent over the rate of interest charged for the money guaranteed by
                        the government whatever may be the amount of the loan</p>
                    <p>3rd. That every person should not obtain more than one loan from the
                        Government guaranteed fund and on the condition that he should not have
                        obtained in 1908 a loan from non guaranteed funds</p>
                    <p>4th. Should the Credit Foncier refuse to fellow these conditions the
                        Government could| take the matter in band by creating a special Department
                        for this purpose and profiting from the difference in the rate of interest
                        which not only will cover the expenditure but will also leave an important
                        surplus.</p>
                    <p>The Government has already helped the credit Foncier by lending them half a
                        million of pounds but I have beard from reliable sources that the greatest
                        part of this sum has been lent to rich people so that the relief instead of
                        falling to the lot of the relatively poor and middle classes has gone to
                        strengthen the position of the rich who with a little sacrifice could hold
                        their own and save their poorer and less favored fellow creatures from
                        certain ruin.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced that the able hands that direct the destinies of this country
                        will not permit the interests of the millions being sacri- ficed for those
                        of the millionaires.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor to remain, Sir, Your most obedient servant NEGHIB SHAKRA.

                    <head> BIMBASHI REUFEE</head>
                    <p>There went to its long eternal rest yesterday the soul of Bimbashi P. H.
                        Renfee. Its passing was of a supremely tragic character. In full pos-
                        session of all bis facilities, the “Major,” as he was termed amongst his
                        many intimates, was playing billiards in the well known saloon of
                        Shepbeard’s Hotel at half past six on Saturday evening, when he suddenly
                        complained of giddiness, and relinquished the game. He was immediately
                        attended to by Doctor Brabant, land taken to a room in the hotel, where he
                        exhibited most serious symptoms. Other doc tors were called, and, in
                        consultation with Doctor Brabant, the consensus of opinion was that the
                        patient was suffering from hemorrhage on the brain. The four doctors in
                        attendance did all that was possible, and the condition of the patient
                        becoming worse, it was decided to transport him to the Deaconesses’ Hospital
                        Here he never recovered from the state of coma into which he had fallen, and
                        passed away yesterday morning at five o'clock.</p>
                    <p> Bimbashi Reufee had experience of much active work in the field, and
                        possessed many medals with clasps for services rendered in Egypt and
                        elsewhere. He was one of the first to enter Cairo after the decisive en-
                        counter with Arabi Pasha's troops at Tel el- Kebir. For many years he was
                        associated with the Police Force in Alexandria and subsequently Cairo. His
                        assiduous and con scientious labours ultimately resulted in his being
                        appointed Governor of the Ghizeh Prison, whence he was transferred to the
                        great central prison of Menshieh, as director, — a posi tion he held at the
                        moment of his untimely death.</p>
                    <p>The funeral took place from the Deavonesses’ Hospital at four yesterday
                        afternoon, the service in the new cemetery being conducted by the Chaplain
                        to the Forces. There was present at the mournful ceremony a vast number of
                        sympathizers, and many beautiful wreaths were sent The cemetery was
                        thronged, land it is quite impossible to give the names of fall present, but
                        we noticed on the cards attached to the floral tributes the names of H.EB.
